本教材使用说明
理想的安排是，每篇课文用两个课时，每课时 50 分钟左右。第 1 课 时用于教师引导下的会话，第 2 课时用于作文和语言学习。这样，本书 内容足够约 200 课时使用(包括测验)。但是，每篇课文也可只用 1 个 课时——在这种情况下，上课时间便应完全用于教师引导下的会话，选 一部分书面练习让学生作为课外作业。教师的首要任务是根据教学计划 规定的时间确定如何运用教材。
下列建议简要地说明了每堂课的讲课步骤。你可以遵照执行，也可 以加以修订以适应你的教学方式，也可以拒之不用——不过，请你先读 一下本说明。
第 1 课时:教师引导下的会话
讲课步骤
1 听力训练 约15分钟
2 理解性问题 约5分钟
3 学生提问题 约5分钟
4 句型训练 约5分钟
5 复述故事 约10分钟
6 讨论题 约10分钟
现把这 6 个步骤分别说明如下:
1 听力训练(大约15分钟)
我们推荐介绍课文的 9 个步骤，以训练学生听懂英语口语的能力。
这 9 个步骤为: a 介绍故事 b 了解情景
c 听力训练目标
d 播放录音或朗读课文
e 回答问题
f 精读
g 再次播放录音或朗读课文
h 重复
i 大声朗读
每一个步骤都必须简洁:
a 介绍故事 教师用几句话介绍课文，这样学生就能清楚课文中发生的是什么事
情，而不需要去猜测。只要有可能就应全部使用英语。以第 1 课为例: Today we'll listen to a story about some people in a theatre.
(今天我们要听一个故事，讲的是在剧场中的几个人。) 《新概念英语》第 2 册的教师用书中对每课书都有一个简要的介绍。 b 了解情景 要求学生看插图，以便检查学生是否了解课文中所发生的事情。教

师可以用英语向学生提几个问题，以协助学生理解图意。仍以第 1 课为 例:
What do you think is happening in the picture?(从图上看你 认为发生了什么事情?)
What isthe man in front doing? Why(?前面那个男人在做什么? 为什么?)
《新概念英语》第 2 册的教师用书中总是提供一些这类问题。
c 听力训练目标 通过给学生提个问题，让他们去寻找答案，教师为学生确立一个“听
力训练目标”。这就意味着学生会积 极 地 而不是消 极 地 去听课文录音。 以第 1 课为例:
Listen to the story, then tell me: Why did the writer complain to the people behind him? (听故事，然后告诉我，为什么作者抱怨 坐在他身后的人?)
《新概念英语》第 2 册教师用书总是提供这样的一个问题。
d 播放录音或朗读课文 教师播放录音或朗读课文，学生不停顿地静听一遍。他们应试图找
到 c 项中所列问题的答案。 e 回答问题
现在教师再一次问第 3 步骤中(即 C 项)的问题，让学生试着回答:
Now you've heard the story,why did the writer complain to the people behind him?(现在你听了这个故事，为什么作者抱怨坐在他身后的人?) 训练学生不要集体高声回答，如果他们认为自己知道答案，请他们举手。 问一个学生，然后问其他人:“你们中有多少人同意他/她的回答?” “如果你们同意，请举起手来。”[对另一个学生]“你不同意，那么你 认为答案是什么?”“你们中有多少人同意他/她的回答?请举起手 来。”这样就能让学生不断地猜测，而且把全 班 学 生 都调动起来了。从 一开始就要训练学生不做任何准备地去听，也不通过翻译。他们很快会 适应英语的语音，并理解他们所听到的内容。
f 精读
现在教师重放录音或重读课文，每句话后停顿，以检查学生是否理 解。这是课堂教学中非常重要的一个环节，因为在介绍课文结束时，学 生应该彻底理解课文。教师不要直接讲解，而应尽量从学生那里获取信 息(可以把这种方法看作是“用螺丝起子拔瓶塞的行动计划”)。讲解 全部要用英文，但不要把直接教学法弄到一种荒唐的绝对程度。在可能 情况下，使用手势和模拟动作。如果班上的一些学生仍无法理解，教师 应该请班上学得最好的学生给出一个单词或词组的译文，以照顾尚未理 解词义的学生。请记住，如果你不把一个难点译成中文，班上的其他人 会这样做的。但是，翻译始终应被看成是最后一着。
g 再次播放录音或朗读课文
不停顿地再次播放录音或朗读课文，因为有了 f 项中的精心解释， 这次学生会很容易听懂。
h 重复
在这个阶段，重复是一项可 供 选 择 的 课堂活动。在任何情况下，这

项活动也应限制——比如说——在第 1 单元的 24 课课文之内。如果你进 行重复训练，首先让全 班 跟着你朗读课文。然后，把全班分为 3 个组， 再次重复课文。最后，在全班范围内让个别学生重复课文。当你让学生 全体或小组重复时，要求学生在看到你的明确信号后才一起开始。你可 用点头或手中的铅笔当信号，想像自己在指挥一个交响乐团。
i 大声朗读
在班上轮流让学生大声朗读课文。从朗读中你可以看出不同的学生 是否能够准确地读出他们听过的英语。
介绍课文的全过程不应超过大概 15 分钟的时间。
不要在任何一项活动中花费太多的时间!
2 理解性问题(大约5分钟) 介绍完课文后，教师应根据教师用书这部分所列的问题，开始提理
解性问题。问题是多种多样的，而且也要求不同的回答。应快速在班上 提问，同时应训练学生自然地回答(比如，不要坚持要求用完整的句子 回答，因为在日常会话中很少用完整的句子)。这项练习的关键是节奏， 因此最好让学生个别回答，而不是集体回答。请注意每个问题后面提供 的简要回答。
3 学生提问题(大约5分钟)
为了防止类似 *Where he went? *的错误问句，需要训练学生同时 问两个问题。第 1 个是一般疑问句，第 2 个是特殊疑问句。例如:
教师: Ask me if I went to the theatre last week. (问我上 周是否去过剧场。)
学生:Did you go to the theatre last week?(上周你去剧场了 吗?)
教师:When⋯? (什么时间⋯⋯?)
学生:When did you go to the theatre? (你是什么时候去的剧 场的?)(而不是 * When you went to the theatre?* 或 *When you go to the theatre?*)
在教师用书的这个部分可以看到详尽的例子，接着是一连串的“Ask me if⋯”练习。
4 句型练习(大约5分钟一个单项练习)
除了录音带上的练习(在教师用书中刊印在Repetition drill这 一部分)，每课书还有句型练习。这些练习属于“提示-回答”这一类型。 你说出一个提示，两个学生回答。每次先和学得最好的学生一起作出明 确的示范，以便学生在开始练习之前就明确要做什么。以下是两个典型 的例子:
教师:hear the radio(听收音机)
学生 1:I can hear the radio now. Can you?(我可以听见收音 机了，你能吗?)
学生 2:Of course, I can. I can hear it perfectly well.(当 然，我能。我能听得非常清楚。)
(在教师用书中还有进一步的提示，因此，你可以在全班讲行这个 练习。)
下面是另一个例子:

教师:see the race----large crowd(看比赛——人群)
学生 1:Didn't you see the race? (你没有看到比赛吗?) 学生2:I couldn't. The crowd was too large.(不行。人太多
了。) (在教师用书中还有进一步的提示，因此，你可以在全班进行这个
练习。) 在班上快速进行训练。在给提示前，一定要明确由哪两个学生来进
行这组练习。如果在训练过程中学生出了错误，要纠正他们，并让他们 重复正确的答案。在这本书中有练习的语法注释，以供教师参考。
记住，录音带上每课练习的文字材料刊印在Repetition drill之 下。见下面第 2 课时。
5 复述故事(大约5分钟)
这部分是一些有编号的要点，合起来便组成课文的摘要。把这些要 点写到黑板上(或在课前写好，先遮挡起来)，然后在班上让学生分别 单独地向你复述故事。这项练习为学生提供有部分准备的、不间断的口 语练习。在学生讲完后仅仅指出主要的错误。不要经常打断他们。
6 讨论题(大约10分钟)
由教师引导的会话课的最后一部分应用于自由会话。应邀请学生试 看表达他们的思想，而不管他们会出多少语言错误。每课的话题会变得 越来越难，可以讨论其中之一或全部都试一试。应要求每个学生对讨论 题都说一两句话。随着会话能力的提高，你可以偶尔在自由会话中多花 费一些时间(可省略诸如“复述故事”之类的练习。)
第 2 课时:作文和语言学习
如上所述，这第 2 课时可以完全不上，而将一部分笔头练习作为课 外作业。如采用这种教学方法，那么，在课外作业中必须布置摘要写作 与作文练习。当然，如果能把一整课时用来做笔头练习，效果必定更为 理想。
讲课步骤
1 理解/摘要写作/作文/书信练习 2 关键句型
3 重复训练
4 语法结构练习
5 难点
6 难点练习
7 听写
8 多项选择题 对本课每一步骤所用时间不作具体建议，因为这会因人因地而异。 1 理解/摘要写作/作文/书信练习 这些练习不论在什么情况下都不应删去，它们是经过精心设计的、
循序渐进的、在教师指导下进行摘要写作和学习作文的教学计划的一部 分，贯穿于《实践与进步》、《培养技能》两本书的始终。由于这些练 习大部分可由学生自行批改，教师只需检查学生是否做了这些作业即可。

学生做练习时，教师可在班中巡视，给予个别辅导。本书中有这些练习 的答案。
2 关键句型
在这一部分应简要解释一下课文中出现的语法现象。在这本书中你 可以找到详尽的专业性注释。这些注释是给教师参考的，应由教师决定 哪些要告诉学生。语法知识应视作达到目的的一种手段，本身并不是目 的。语法术语在学生用书中故意剔除了，语法如何讲由教师决定。而这 反过来又完全取决于班上学生的情况。如果班上学生熟悉母语的语法， 那么教师不妨用些语法术语;如果学生对语法概念一无所知，那么，教 师连一个语法术语都不应使用。解释语法的目的在于从理论上巩固学生 在口头练习中获得的知识。最好避免面面俱到地讲“规则”，而当以课 文中讲到的语法现象为限。若想增加语法知识，可以参考任何一本标准 的语法练习册。
3 重复训练
学生听录音做练习，既可在教室用录音机播放，自学的学生也可在 家里听录音做。另一种办法是教师口头读出练习，“现场”在课堂上指 导学生进行训练。
4 语法结构练习
此项练习应以笔头完成，以便巩固刚刚解释过的语法知识。本书附 有这些练习的全部答案。
5 难点
对于词汇/语法结构上的特殊难点现在应作出简要的解释。这一部 分的重点集中在由于学生的母语干扰而造成误用和混用的词和结构上。 在适当的时机，可将课文里出现的问题与学生母语中的类似问题作一简 单的比较。
6 难点练习
此项练习应以笔头完成，用以巩固刚刚教过的内容。本书附有这些 练习的全部答案。
7 听写
只要时间允许，听写练习应经常进行。可从学生刚刚学过的课文中 摘取个别句子作为听写的内容。学生可对照课文自行批改。听写是训练 句法、拼写和听力的一项极好的练习。
8 多项选择题
多项选择题是一种测试手段，而不是一种教学手段。目的是为了培 养学生应付公共测试中常见的客观试题的能力。多项选择题包含以下方 面的练习:阅读理解、结构和词汇。多项选择题之后是一项有关句型的 练习。本书附有这些练习的全部答案。
课外作业
随着学习的不断深入，笔头作业会越来越难，越来越费时间。学到 本教材的后面几课，凡在课堂上无法完成的练习可留作课外作业。
单元前的测验
此项测验必须在学生开始新的一个单元学习之前进行。
继续深造
凡想继续深造的学生，学完本书后可以接着学习以下各册。教材之

间内容相互“重叠”，学生继续学习不会觉得困难:
Developing Skills《培养技能》:中级水平综合教材
Fluency in English《流利英语》:高级水平综合教材 “教师引导下的会话”演示课 为了演示，我们选择了《实践与进步》的第 1 课作范例。在《本教
材使用说明》中所列的步骤演示如下。
1 听力训练(大约15分钟)
请参见前面讲的介绍课文的 9 个步骤。
a 介绍故事 教师(在问候全班之后):今天，我想让你们听一个有关去剧场看
戏的故事，故事题目是“私人谈话”。 b 了解情景
教师:看图，然后告诉我你认为发生了什么事情。前面的男人在做 什么?为什么?
c 听力训练目标
教师:看着我，请注意听。我将要给你们读这个故事。等我读完之 后，我会问你们这个问题:为什么作者抱怨坐在他身后的人?准备好了 吗?
d 播放录音或朗读课文
e 回答问题 教师:那么，为什么作者抱怨坐在他身后的人呢?不，不，不要大
声回答!我会问你们的。你是怎么想的，[学生姓名]?谁同意他/她的 回答?请举起手来!嗯，那么你是怎么相的，[另一学生姓名]?你们之 中有多少人同意他/她的回答?好，你说得对!作者抱怨坐在他身后的 人，是因为他们在那里讲话。是的。很好，[学生姓名]。作者听不清楚 这个剧。那么，他的感受如何呢，[学生姓名]?是的，他很生气!对。
f 精读
教师:现在，请看着第 1 课，我们要仔细地过一遍，要保证每一个 人都理解这篇课文。准备好了吗?题目“A private conversation”是 什么意思?我们先看 conversation这个词。conversation是⋯⋯，[学 生姓名] ?是的，对。它是谈话。那么 private conversation是什么意 思呢?是哪一种谈话?什么?你我之间的谈话。对。不关他的事，也不 关她的事。它是私人之间的。“Last week I went to the theatr”e.went 当然是动词⋯⋯的过去时。对，动词 go 。我去了剧场。在剧场你能看见 什么呢?不，不是一个作品，是一个⋯⋯?是的，是一个剧。你去剧场 看剧。“I had a very good seat. ”seat 和 chair 之间有什么区别? 是的，它是指你坐的地方。但是，请注意它们之间的区别: seat 是指你 在剧场或电影院的座位，而 chair 是你在家里能找到的椅子。你可以搬 起一把椅子(chair)，把它挪到另外一个地方，但是，你通常不能搬动 一个座位(seat)。
如此等等，一句话一句话地将课文过完，保证所有句型结构和词项 的含意都充分地传达给了学生。请注意信息如何从学生自己那里获取。 这就是“用螺丝起子拔瓶塞”的含意。不要在学生已很清楚的单词和表 达方式上浪费时间，把注意力集中在难点上。不鼓励学生大声说出母语

中的同义词，虽然这种情况有时会发生。要时常鼓励学生用英语来完成 你的句子，以显示他们已经理解了这些词的用法。只有在你想证实一下 一些特殊的难点已经被学生理解时，才可以请班上学得最好的学生给出 “证实性的译文”。
g 再次播放录音或朗读对话 教师:现在，我们再听一遍这个故事。准备好了吗?
h 重复
教师:现在请跟着我读这个故事。准备好了吗?
Last week I went to the theatre.[给一个明显的信号]
学生: Last week I went to the theatre. 请记住:在这个阶段，重复是一项可供选择的课堂活动，而且无论
如何，重复也应限制在第 1 单元的 24 课课文之内。 i 大声朗读
教师:请再看着课文。请[学生姓名] 开始读课文好吗?[学生读课 文中的几句话，读后教师纠正发音。]好了，谢谢，[学生姓名]。注意 seat 这个词的读音，是/si:t/，而不是/sIt/。请跟我读/si:t/。谢谢。 现在请接着往下读，[学生姓名] 。
  以这种方式继续下去，直到几个学生把整篇课文读完。
2 理解性问题(大约5分钟)
参见教师用书中的这一部分。
教师:现在，我要就这个故事向你们提几个问题。准备好了吗?上 周你去哪里了?[先对全班学生，然后对单个学生]
学生:到剧场去了。 教师:剧有意思吗?[先对全班学生，然后对单个学生] 学生:是的，有意思。 就这样进行下去。应在班上快速提问题。如果愿意可以加一些额外
的问题。请记住先面对全班提出一个问题，稍稍停顿后，转向某一个学 生。提问的速度要快，因此最好不叫出名字，而是直接用手指某个学生。
3 学生提问题(大约5分钟)
参见教师用书中的这一部分。
教师:现在，我要你们向我提几个问题。准备好了吗?[学生姓名]， 问我上周是否去了剧场。学生: Did you go to the theatre last week?
教师:(Yes, I did.) When⋯⋯?
学生:[犯了一个错误:] When you went to the theatre? 教师:不对。听着， Did you go to the theatre last week? 这
是一个疑问句，现在把 When 放在句首。
学生:[又犯了一个错误:] When did you go to the theatre last
week?
教师:不对。 When did you go to the theatre? “Last week”
是答案。
学生: When did you go to the theatre? 教师:(Last week)对了。 就这样快速地在班上进行下去。
4 句型练习(大约5分钟一个单项练习)

参见教师用书中的这一部分。
教师:现在，我们来练习造简单句。我们分成两人一组来练习。我 将提供“walk across the stage ----slow”这样的提示，然后，[学生 1 的姓名] 你问:
How did she walk across the stage
然后，你[学生 2 的姓名]回答:
She walked very slowly across the stage. 现在让我们来练习。
[指着两个学生] walk across the stage----slow
学生 1: How did she walk across the stage?
学生 2:She walked very slowly across the stage. 教师:好。现在继续。
[指着两个学生] behave at the theatre ----rude
学生 1:How did she behave at the theatre?
学生 2:She behaved very rudely at the theatre.
教师:好。 以很快的速度在班上继续这种练习。在给出提示前，一定要明确由
哪两位学生来做此练习。不要在任何一个练习上花太多的时间。
5 复述故事(大约10分钟)
参见教师用书中的这一部分。
把提供的要点抄在黑板上。最好是上课前先抄好，然后用东西先遮 挡住。
教师:现在请看黑板。我要你们试着借助这些要点来复述故事。请 你开个头好吗，[学生姓名]?[学生把第 1、2 点或更多的要点重组成故 事，结束后你纠正他的错误。]好，现在由你[学生姓名]继续讲下去。[学 生继续，结束后你纠正错误。]
就这样在班上进行下去，让几个学生复述课文，可以复述几遍。请 记住，永远没有必要要求学生在语言上做到完美无缺。在学生讲的时候， 如有必要你可随时提示。
6 讨论题(大约10分钟)
参见教师用书中的这一部分。
教师:现在，告诉我你去剧场或电影院的一次经历。[学生姓名]你 最近一次去剧场或电影院是什么时候?你看了什么?你喜欢吗?为什 么?那么你呢，[另一个学生姓名]?你最喜欢哪类戏剧或电影?等等。
试着为你的练习计算好时间，这样在每课时中就可以完成所有的练 习。通过实践，这很容易做到。重要的是不要在任何一项活动上花太多 的时间:每一堂课都必须丰富多彩、有节奏并且表达方式要生动有力。 但是，如果你偶尔无法做完全部练习，也不要担心。下一课时开始新课。 不要企图补上前一课时的内容。这些有引导的会话练习的成效要在积累 中体现，学生的会话能力会逐渐提高的。
如果你按照建议的步骤来上教师引导的会话课，你不仅能提高作为 教师的技能，而且也能增强自己的英语流利程度，因为你不仅在讲授英 语知识，而且一直在使用这种语言。

How to use this book
Allocation of time
Ideally, two classroom lessons of approximately 50 minutes
each should be spent on each text. The first lesson should be devoted to Guided Conversation; the second to Composition and language study. This means that there is enough material in this book for 200 lessons (including tests). However, you may choose
to spend only one classroom lesson on each te-x-t-- in which case, every lesson may be devoted to Guided composition and a selection of exercises may be set as homework. Your first task is to decide how much time you have in your programme in relation to the material available in the course.
The suggestions given below outline the basic steps in each lesson. You may decide to follow them closely, adapt thetmo suit your style of teaching, or reject them altogether---- BUT PLEASE READ THEM FIRST!
Lesson 1: Guided conversation
The stages of the Lesson
1 Listening comprehension
2 Comprehension questions
3 Asking questions
4 Pattern drill
5 Tell the story
6 Topics for discussion
Let's see what each step involves:
1 Listening comprehension (about 15 munutes)
There are nine recommneded steps for presenting each text which
will train students to understand spoken English. The steps are as follows:
a Introduce the story
b Understand the situation
c Listening objective
d Play the tape or read the text
e Answer the question
f Intensive reading
g Play the tape or read the text again
h Repetition
i Reading aloud
Every one of these steps must be very brief:
a Introduce the story
The teacher introduces the text with a few words, so the student
about 15 minutes
about 5 minutes
about 5 minutes
about 5 minutes
about 10 minutes
about 10 minutes

clearly understands what's goingon and is not obliged to guess. English should be used entirely as far as possible. For example (Text 1):
Today we'll listen to a story about some people in a theatre.
NCE Teacher's Book 2 always provides a brief introduction to each text.
b Understanding the situation
The students are asked to look at the cartoon to see if they can understand what is going on in the text. The teacher may ask a few questions in English to .help the students to understand the picture.
For example (Text 1):
What do you think is happening in the picture?
What is the man in front doing? Why?
NCE Teacher's Book 2 always provides a few questions of this
kind.
c Listening objective
The teacher gives the students‘a listening objective’, by setting them a question they will try ot find the answer to. This means, the students will listen to the text actively rather than passively.
    For example (Text 1):
    Listen to the story, then tell me: Why did the writer complain
to the people behind him?
NCE Teacher's Book 2 always provides a qusetion of this kind.
d Play the tape or read the text
The teacher plays the tape or reads the text just once while the students simply listen without interruption. They should try to‘hear’the answer to the question given in c above.
e Answer the question
Now the teacher asks the question (c above) again and the students try to answer it:‘Now you've heard the story, why did
the writer complain to the people behind him’?Don't let students shout out the answer. Train them to raise their hands if they think they know the answer. Get one student to answer, then ask the others, ‘How many of you agree with him/her’?‘Put up your hands if you agree with him/her.’‘You don't agree (to another student), so
what do you think the answer is? ’‘How many of you agree
with .him/her? Put up your hands’.This keeps the students guessing
and involves the whole class. Students should be trained to listen right from the start witho‘utpreparation’or‘translation’. They
will soon get used to the sound of English and to understanding
the meaning of what they hear.
f Intensive reading

Now the teacher plays the tape or reads the text again, pausing after every sentence to check the students understand. This is an extremely important part of the lesson as the students must fully understand the text at the end of the presentation. Rather than give direct explanations, try to get as much information as possiblefromthestudents(thinkofi‘tascorkscrewoperation’!). Explanations should be given entirely in English, but don't carry direct-method teaching to absurd lengths. Use gesture and mime where possible. If some of your students still don't understand, ask the best students in the class fo‘r caonfirmatory translation’
of a particular word or phrase for the benefit of other students who haven't grasped the meaning. Remember, if you don't translate a particular difficulty, then someone in the class will. However, translation should always be regarded as a last resort.
g Play the tape or read the text again
Play the tape or read the text a gain right through without interruption. This time, the students will understand it without difficulty because of the careful explanation you provided in f above.
h Repetition
Repetition is an optional activity at this level, and in ayn case should be confined to (say) the first cycle of 24 lessons only. If you conduct repetition exercises, first ask the whole class to repeat the text after you. Next divide the class into three groups and repeat the text once more. Finally, ask individual students round the class to repeat the text. When conducting chorus and group repetition, make sure the students repeat all together after you give them a clear signal. You can give such a signal simply by nodding or with a pencil in your hand. Imagineyou're conducting
an orchestra!
i Reading aloud
Ask a few students to read the text aloud, taking turns round the class.
You will be able to tell from this how well particular students can pronounce correctly the English they have already heard.
This presentation should not take more than about fifteen minutes.
DON'T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON ANY ONE ACTIVITY!
2 Comprehension questions (about 4 minutes)
Once the text has been presented, proceed with the comprehension question listed for you in. this sectio n of the Teacher's Book. The questions are mixed and demand a variety of responses. They should be asked rapidly round the class and the students should be trained to answer naturally ( i.e. don't insist

on complete answers where they would not normalle gi ven in the course o ordinary conversation) .The essence of this exercise is pace, so it's better to get the students to answer individually rather than in chorus. Note that brief answers as provided for you after each question.
3 Asking questoins (about 5 minutes)
In order to prevent incorrect forms like * Where he went? *, students are trained to ask two questions at a time. The .first of these is a yes/no question and the second a Wh-question. For example:
TEACHER: Ask me if I went to the theatre last week.
STUDENT: Did you go to the theatre last week?
TEACHER: When⋯?
STUDENT: When did you go to the theatre? (Not * When you went
to the theatre?* or * When you go to the-theatre?*)
The Teacher's Book, gives you a full example in this section,
followed by a list of‘Ask me if ⋯’exercises.
4 Pattern drill (about 5 munutes for a single drill)
In addition to the exercise on tape (printed in the Teacher's Book under (about 5 minutes the head‘inRgepetition drill’), there are pattern drills for each lesson. for asingle drill) These are all‘stimulus-response’exercises. You provide a‘stimulus’and two students respond. Always give a clear example first with your best students, so students know exactly what to do before attempting each exercise. Here are a couple of ytpical examples.
TEACHER: hear the radio
STUDENT 1: I can hear the radio now. Can you?
STUDENT 2: Of course, I can. I can hear it perfectly well. (Further prompts are listed in the Teacher's Book, so you can
conduct the exercise round the class.)
Here is another example:
TEACHER: see the race ---- large crowd
STUDENT 1: Didn't you see the race?
STUDENT 2: I couldn't. The crowd was too large.
(Further prompts are listed in the Teacher's Book, so you can
conduct the exercise round the class.)
Continue round the class at a brisk pace. Always indicate which
two students will make each exchange before giving the cue or cues. If, during a drill, students make mistakes, correct them, and get them to repeat the correct response. Grammatical note s on the Pattern drill are provided in this book, in case you wish to refer to them.
Remember, material recorded on tape is given for each lesson under the heading Repetition drill. See below in Lesson 2.

5 Tell the story (about 10 minutes)
This section consists of numbered notes which form a summary
of the text. Write the notes on the blackboard (or have them written up and covered before the lesson begins) and ask individual students round the class to tell you the story. This gives students semi-prepared practice in speaking without interruption. Point out only the main errors made after students finish .speaking. Don't constantly interrupt them!
6 Topics for discussion (about 10 minutes)
The final part of the Guided conversation Lesons should be devotedtofreeconversation.Studentsshouldbeinvited‘tohave
a go’at expressing their own ideas, no matter how many mistakes they make. The topics become progressively harder within each lesson and one or all of them may be attemptedd.ivIindual students should be invited to make one or two statements about the topics. As conversational skill develops, you may occasionally arrange to spend more time on free conversation (omitting, for example, such exercises as‘Tell the story’).
Lesson 2: Composition and language study
As has already been indicated, this entire lesson may be omitted and a selection of written exercises may, instead, be set as homework. If this approach is adopted, then the Summary and Composition exercises must always be set. Needless to say, more satisfactory results will be obtained where a complete classroom lesson can be devoted to written exercises .
    The stages of the Lesson
    1  Comprehension/Summary writing/Composition/Letter writing
    2  Key structures
    3  Repetition drill
    4  Exercises on grammatical structure
    5  Special difficulties
    6  Exercises on special difficulties
    7  Dictation
    8  Multiple choice questions
    No specific suggestions are made regarding the amount of time
to be spent on each part of the lesson as this will be found to vary greatly.
1 Comprehension/Summary writing/Letter writing
These written exercises must never be omitted because they are part of a carefully planned summary and composition programme which evolves Composition/ progressively throu gh Practice and Progressive and Developing Skills. As the exercises are largely

self-correcting, it will be sufficient to check that they have been done. Go round the class while students are writing and help individuals. Keys to exercises are contained in this book.
2 Key structures
This part of the lesson should be devoted to a brief explanation of the main grammar points that were presented in the text. You will find full technical explanations in this book. These explanations are for your informationand you have to decide how much of this to pass on to your students. Grammatical information should be considered as a means to an end, not as an end in itself. Technical terms have been deliberately avoided in the Students' Book: it has been left to theetacher to decide how to present the grammar. This, in turn, will depend wholly on the class. In the case of students who are familiar with the grammar of their own language, there is no reason why the teacher should not make use
of a few technical terms. In .the case of students who are wholly unfamiliar with grammatical concepts, no technical terms should be used at all. The aim behind all the explanations should be to reinforce theoretically what the students have already practised orally. It is best to avoid sweeping‘rules’and to confine the study of grammar to the points presented. Additional information can be obtained from any standard grammar practice book.
3 Repetition drill
The students practise the taped drill. They may do this with the aid of a cassette player in the classroom, or at home if they are working on their own. Alternatively, the teacher may conduct the drill‘live’from the tapescript printed in the lesson.
4 Exercises on grammatical structure
These should be tackled in writing. They wlil provide further reinforcement of the grammar that has just been presented. Answers to all these exercises will be found in this book.
5 Special difficulties
A brief explanation regarding the special lexical/structural difficulties should now be given. This section concentrates on words and structures often misused and confused as a result of interference from the students' mother tongue. Where appropriate, you may draw a brief contrast between the problem presented in the text and a similar problem in the mother tongue.
6 Exercises on special difficulties
These should be tackled in writing to reinforce what has just been special difficulties presented. Answers to all these exercises will be found in this book.
7 Dictation
Depending on the amount of tiem available, dictations should

be given frequently. A few sentences taken from a passage the students have already studied may be dictated. The students may correct their own work by comparing their version with the passage. Dictation is an excellent exerc ise in syntax, spelling, and listening comprehension.
8 Multiple choice questions
Multiple choice is a testing device, not a teaching device. Its purpose questions here is to train students for the kind of objective testing which is usal in public examinations. Multiple choice exercises cover the following: reading comprehension, structure and vocabulary. Multiple choice exercises are followed
by an exercise in sentence structure. exercises will be found in this book.
Homework
The written exercises become more
as the student progresses through the
exercises which have not been completed in class may be set as homework.
Pre-unit tests
These should always be set before the students move on to a new Unit.
Future work
If the student wishes to proceed further, he may go on to the following books after completing this one. They are designed to ‘overlap’each other so that the student can continue without difficulty:
    Developing Skills:
    An Integrated Course for Intermediate Students
    Fluency in English:
    An Integrated Course for Advanced Students
Demonstration lesson for‘guided converstation’
Lesson 1 in the Students' Book of Practice and Progress has been selected for demonstration purposes. The steps outlined in the section HOW TO USE THIS BOOK are now demonstrated in practice.
1 Listening comprehension (about 15 minutes)
Refer to the nine steps of Lesson 1 in the Teacher's Book.
a Introduce the story
TEACHER: (after greeting the class): Today, I want you to listen to a minutes ) story about a visit to the theatre. The story is called‘A Private Conversation’.
b Understand the situation
TEACHER: Look at the picture. What do you think is happening? What is the man in front doing? Why?
c Listening objective
Answers to all these
demanding and t-icmoensuming course. At a later stage,

TEACHER: Look at me and listen please. I'm going to read you the story. After I finish reading it, I'm going to ask you this question: Why did the writer complain to the people behind him? Ready?
d Play the tape or read the text
e Answer the question
TEACHER: So why did the writer complain to the people behind
him? No. No. Don't shout out the answer! I will ask you. What do you think, [name of student]? Who agrees with him/her? Put your hands up please! Hm. So whadto you think, [name of another student]? How many of you agree with him/her? Good. You're right! The writer complained to the people behind him because they were talking! Yes, that's right, [name of student]. The writer couldn't hear the play! So how did he feel, (name of student]? Yes, he was annoyed! Good.
f Intensive reading
TEACHER: Now look at Lesson 1 please. We'll go through it carefully and make sure everyone has understood it. Ready? Now what about the title,‘A Private Conversation'? Let's take the ward conversation first. A conversation is a ...? [name of student] Yes, that's right. It's a talk. But what about a private conversation, what kind of talk is that? Yes? A talk between you and me. Good. It's not his business or her business. It's privaet. “Last week
I went to the theatre”. Went, of course, is the past tense of the verb ...?, Yes, go. I went to the theatre. What would you expect to see at a theatre? No, it's not a work. It's a ...? Yes, it's
a play. You'd go to the theatre to see a play‘.I had a very good seat.' Now what's the difference between a seat and a chair? Yes, it's somewhere you sit. But notice the difference between seat to describe where you sit in a theatre or a cinema, and chair which you would find in your home. You can pickup a chair and move it somewhere else, but you can't usually do this to a seat.
And so on, through the text, sentence by sentence, making sure the meanings of the structures and content words are fully communicated. Note how the information is obtained fr om the students themselves. That's what is meant by a ‘ corkscrew operation’. Don't waste time on words and expressions the students know really well: concentrate only on difficulties. Discourage the students from shouting out mother-tongue equivalent, though this will inevitably happen occasionally. Now and again, encourage the students to complete sentences with English words to show they have understood their use. Ask f‘orconfirmatory translations’from your best students only when you wish to confirm thsaotme particularly difficult item has been understood.
g Play the tape or read the text again

TEACHER: Now we'll listen to the story again. Ready?
h Repetition
TEACHER: Now repeat the story after me. Ready?
Last week I went to the theatre. (Give a clear signal) STUDENTS: Last week I went to the theatre.
Remember, repetition is optional at this level and in any case
should be confined to the first twenty-four lessons.
i Reading aloud
TEACHER: Now look at the text again. Would you start reading the storyplease [name of student]. [Student] reads a few sentences of the text and the teacher corrects pronunciation at the end. That's all thank you, [name of student]. Note the pronunciation of the word seat: /si:t/ not I/ts/. Say it after me please: /si:t/. Thank you. Now continue please, [name of student].
And so on until the complete text has been read by a few students.
2 Comprehension questions (about 5 munutes)
Refer to this section in the Teacher's Book.
TEACHER: Now I'm going to ask you some questionosutabthe story. minutes) Ready? Where did you go last week? (to class as a whole before indicating an individual student)
STUDENT: (To) the theatre.
    TEACHER: Was it an interesting play? (to class as a whole before
indicating an individual student)
STUDENT: Yes, it was.
And so on. Ask questions rapidly round the class, adding a few more of your own if you want to. Please remember to direct each question to the class as a whole, then pause slightly before
indicating an individual. The pace should be fast, so not to call out students’names, but simply to point.
3 Asking questions (about 5 munutes)
Refer to this section in the Teacher's Book.
TEACHER: Now I want you to ask me some questions. of student] Ask me if I went to the theatre last week.
it's best
Ready? [name
STUDENT: Did you go to the theatre last week?
TEACHER: (Yes, I did.) When⋯?
STUDENT: (making a mistake:) When you went to the theatre? TEACHER: No. Listen. Did you go to the theatre last week? That's
the question. Now put When in front of it.
STUDENT: (making another mistake:) When did you go to the
theatre last week?
TEACHER: No. When did you go to the theatre?‘Last week’is
the answer!
    STUDENT: When did you go to the theatre?

TEACHER: (Last week.) That's better. And so on, rapidly round the class.
4 Pattern drill (about 5 minutes for a single drill)
Refer to this section in the Teacher's Book.
TEACHER: Now we're going to practise making simple sentences. We'll practise in pairs: I'll give you cues lik‘ewalk across the stage ---- slow’. Then you, [name of Student 1] will ask:
How did she walk across the stage?
and you [name of Student 2] will answer:
She walked very slowly across the stage.
Let's try it.
(indicate two students) walk across the stage----slow
STUDENT 1: How did she walk across the stage?
STUDENT 2: She walked very slowly across the stage.
TEACHER: Good. Now we'll continue.
(indicate two students) behave at the theatre----rude
STUDENT 1: How did she behave at the theatre?
STUDENT 2: She behaved very rudely at the theatre.
TEACHER: Good.
Continue round the class at a brisk pace. Always indicate which
two students will make each exchange before giving the cues. Don't spend too long on any one drill.
5 Tell the story (about 10 minutres)
Refer to this section in the Teacher's Book.
Copy the notes provided onto the blackboard, or, preferably, have them written up and covered before the lesson begins.
TEACHER: Now look at the blackboard please. I want you to try and tell me the story from these notes. Would you begin please, [name of student]? (Student reconstructs points I and 2 (or more) and you correct him after he has finished.) Good, now you continue please, [name of student]. (Student continues and you correct him after he has finished.)
And so on round the cla,ssasking a few students to reconstruct the text a few times. Remember, it is never necessary for the students to be word-perfect and you may prompt them as often as is necessary while they are speaking.
6 Topics for discussion (about 10 minutes)
Refer to this section in the Teacher's Book.
TEACHER: Now tell me about a visit to the theatre or cinema. When (about 10 did you last go to the theatre/cinema [name of student]? minutes) What did you see? How did you enjoy it? Why? What about you [name of anothertusdent]? What kinds of plays/films do you like best? etc .
    Try to time the exercises so that you complete them all in each

Lesson. With practice, this will come easily. It is important not to spend too long on any one activity: eachsolnesmust have variety, pace and attack. But if occasionally you don't. get through all the exercises, don't worry. During the next lesso-nperiod, go on
to a new lesson. Don't attempt to complete the previous one. These guided conversation exercises are cumulative in their effect and the students' skill in conversation will develop gradually.
If you conduct the guided conversation lessons in the way suggested above, you will not only improve your skills as a teacher, but you will also improve your own fluenyc in English because you will be using the language all the time, not just talking about
it!

(55 words)
Key structures: Word order in simple statements
a
    The text consists of simple sentences, that is, sentences which
contain one subject and one predicate:
The play (subject) was very interesting (predicate). b
The basic word order in an English sentence is:
(6) 1 2 3 (Time /Subje /Verb /Object or ) ct Complement
4 5 (6) /Manner /Plac /(Time
e )

The children played games quietly in their room yesterday. Yesterday the children played games quietly in their room.
c
Not all these elements have to be present at any one time. The
basic order can be varied (e.g. He immediately sent for a doctor, etc. ) but at this stage it is best to keep the order (T)/S/V/O/M/P/(T). The most notable exception to this wordorder occurs with adverbs of frequency. (See KS 2)
Time expressions may occur at the beginning or at the end of a sentence.
Pattern drill
1 She walked very slowly across the stage. S/V/M/P.
2 I can hear the radio now. S/V/O/T.
I can hear it perfectly well. S/V/O/M. Note the use of can (a)
with a verb of perception in the resent tense, and (b) in short answers and questions (Of course I can. Can you?)
3 I heard a good talk on the radio last night. (T)/S/V/O/P/T. Note can (could) is not necessary with verbs of perception in the past tense.
4 Didn't you see the race?- I couldn't. Could is used with verbs in the past tense to indicate ability.
Repetition drill
Chorus, group or individual repetition
To elicit simple statements inanswer to questions beginning
with Who, What, How, Where, and When. T:Listen. Do not speak.
(1)
T:What did you listen to? The news? S:Yes, I listened to the news.

Key structures: The simple past (regular and irregular verbs)
a
The simple past is most often used to describe actions which have been performed and completed and have little or no connection with the present situation (contrast KS 19). Exact time references are usually included (or at least understood).
b
The regular past is formed by adding -ed to the infinitive: climbed, passed. But note: verbs ending in-e add -d only: died, saved; verbs ending in consonant+-y change-y to-i before adding -ed: tried, carried (but: obey, obeyed).
    c
    Note also the three ways of pronouncing these endings:
    /d/ after a voiced sound: climbed, died, owed, saved, stayed,
carried, etc.
/t/ after a voiceless sound: crashed, passed, asked, laughed,
shopped, etc.
/Id/ after-t or-d: visited, handed, repeated, needed, wanted,
waited, etc.

d
    The following irregular verbs (listed with the past tense)
occur in this Lesson:
begin began; bring brought; buy bought; catch caught; choose. chose; come came; do did; get got; give gave; go went; hit hit ; keep kept; leave left; lend lent; loes lost; make made; pay paid; read read ; run ran; see saw; sell sold; send sent; sit sat; sleep slept; spend spent; spoil spoilt; swim swam; teach taught; think thought; write wrote; understand understood.
Pattern drill
1 Do you ever go abroad in term-time? - Yes, I went abroad last term. The simple past (regular and irregular verbs) is contrasted with the simple present (+ ever).

(48 words)
Key structures:The present perfect simple
a The present perfect is used to describe an action which:
i. Took place at an indefinite past time (the exacttime is not important and riot given), but whose effects are still evident in the present:I have read the letter, but I don't understand it.
ii. Began in the past and still continues (or has only just finished). It is often used with for + a period of tmie or since + a point of time (see KS 28):
He has been there for six months (and is still there).
He has never been abroad before (i. e. until now; he has just gone).
Compare:He has never been abroad (not in the past and not now).
iii. Has just been completed:I have just received a letter from my brother.
iv. Involves the use of already in affirmative statements and yet in negative statements and questions:
He has (already) visited a great number of places (already). Note the alternative positions of already:
The train hasn't arrived yet. Has she arrived yet? Hasn't he
come yet?
b Note the contrast between have gone and have been:

He has gone to Alice Springs (i.e. he is there or is on his way there).
He has been to Alice Springs (i. e. he was theronce, but he is not there now).
Pattern drill
1 Have you received Tim's letter yet? Note the use of yet in questions.
2 Why don't you read that book? Note the use of Why don't you ... ? to make a suggestion.
Because I've already read it. Already in an affirmative statement.
3 He's gone to Australia.---- He's never been there before, has he?
Have gone and have been are contrasted. The final has he? may have a rising intonation (the speaker is asking a question) or a falling intonation (the speaker is merely seeking confirmation of what he believes to be true).
4 Has the train arrived? (i. e. Is it here now?) Note the absence of any time reference.
No, it hasn't arrived yet. Alternative negative responses can be made:No, it hasn't . No, not yet.

Key structures:The simple past and the present perfect
a A contrast is drawn between the simple past and the present perfect (See KS 3, 4).
b Note the exact time references in the simple pa:stI wrote to him last month. I bought this car last year.
He came to see me this morning, etc.
c Note the absence of precise time references in the present perfect:I've already seen that film.
Have you ever met him before? Up till now he has wonfive prizes, etc.
Pattern drill

1 Has the train left? No time reference.
Yes, it's just left. It left a minute ago. The same action is described in two ways :just + present perfect indicates recent action; the simple past + a minute ago gives the exact time. (:Note It's = It has; compare:it's = it is.)
2 The present perfect + ever (a vague reference to past time continuing up to the presemt) is contrasted withthe simple past + exact time.
3 He's gone abroad (and not yet returned). Note the rising intonation on Really? in the response, indicating surprise.
4 Note that the present tense is NOT possible here.

Key structures:The indefinite and definite articles
a The distinction between countable (unit) and uncountable (mass) nouns must be clearly esatblished since it affects the use of a/an and some. (For the use of any, see KS 30)
Countables:
I bought a book (one book, unspecified).
I bought some books (an unspecified number).
Books are not very expensive (general statement): Uncountables:
I bought some flour (an unspecified quantity),
Milk is very refreshing (general statement).
Some nouns can be countable or uncountable depending on the
sense:
I want to borrow a rubber (= an eraser). We get rubber (the material) from Malaysia.

b The definite article the (/J+/ before consonants and /J!/ before vowels) is used when the person or thing referred to has already been mentioned, is the only one of its kind in a particular situation, or is explained in the same sentence:
I bought the books (i.e. the ones you asked me to buy).
Put those books on the table (i.e. there is only one table in the room).
Give me the books on the table (i.e. the books which are on the table).
c Articles are not generally used before names of people, streets, towns, countries, etc. (but see KS 30).
Pattern drill
1
Note these common expressions (a bottle of, etc.) to indicate fairly precise quantities.
2
You drink a lot of tea. Note a lot of + uncountable (NOT much in affirmative statements).
I couldn't live without tea. General statement, no article.
3
It has a nice radio. Just‘a radio’- not a particular one. I like the radio. The particular radio I have just mentioned. 4

Key structures:The past continuous
a
A continuous action (indicated by the continuous past tense) is contrasted with a sudden and quickly completed action (shown by the simple past). This inv olves the use of the temporal conjunctions when, while, as and just as.
While I was watering the garden, it began to rain.
I was having breakfast when the telephone rang.
The continuous action is interrupted. Notice that in the
examples above, the temporal conjunction may be used with either clause; a comma is needed if it is used with the first.
b
While may be used to introduce two parallel actions which are in progress at the same time:
While George was reading, his wife was listening to the stereo. George was reading while his wife was listening to the stereo. c
(46 words)

The past continuous may be used to refer to an uninterrupted action which is in progress over a given period of time (all day, all night, etc.):
Detectives were waiting at the airport all morning.
Pattern drill
1 I broke it while I was skiing. Interrupted action with while.
2 I was getting into the bath when it rang. Interrupted action with when.
3 What were you doing all morning? Uninterrupted action over a period of time in the past.

Key structures:The passive
a
In the active voice, attention is usually focused on the person, animal or thing carrying out an action; in the passive voice, attention is usually focused on the thing done:
Prisoners of war built this bridge in 1942. (Who) The bridge was built in 1942. (What)
b
Note the form of the passive in:
(45 words)

the present continuous:AM/IS/ARE + BEING + PAST PARTICIPLE A new road is being built outside my
house.
the simple present:AM/IS/ARE + PAST PARTICIPLE
Our papers are delivered every morning. the simple past:WAS/WERE + PAST PARTICIPLE
A letter was delivered this morning.
c
By + agent is often omitted when it adds nothing to the se:nse The thief was arrested (obviously by the police). If someone else or a particular policeman did the arresting, the agent is a:dd⋯ed by a very young policeman. However, This music was composed needs an agent or another phrase such as in 1816 to complete it (see Pattern Drill 1 and 2).
Pattern drill
1 Who was the Hovercraft invented by? Note the position of by.
I think it was invented by an Englishman. By + agent is essential here for identification.
2 It was built in 1937. Again the use of the passive in the simple past. The passive is often used where, as here, the agent is not known.
3 It's being painted now. hTe use of the passive in the present continuous. Here we are not concerned with the agent and our attention is wholly on the action (painted).
4 It was painted two years ago. The use of the passive in the simple past with exact time references.

Key structure:The simple future
a The modals shall and will + infinitive are used to express the simple future. Do not emphasize the distinction between shall and will. Shall can be used in the 1st person singular and plural but it is quite correct to use will in all persons.
see him then.
we - plenty of time

b The distinction between shall and will is often completely lost in speech because both these modals are usually contracted to'll, especially after pronouns:
I shall/will see you tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow.
We shall/will travel by air. We'll travel by air, etc.
c In spoken English the contraction'll is often used with
names, (pro)nouns and interrogative pronouns:
George'll be here this evening. The concert'll begin at six.
When'll it begin? etc.
d Particular attention should be paid to the negative
contractions:will not = won't and shall not = shan't.

Key structures:The future continuous
a Shall and will are used with be + v-eirnbg to form the future continuous tense.
A parallel can be drawn between the present and future continuous forms to show the progressive aspect of th-eing form:
I am writing letters now (in progress at the moment).
I shall be writing letters all day tomorrow (in progress tomorrow).
to write
of invitations to write!
so. We'll probably be writing them all day.

b The main use of the future continuous ito express a future without intention.
In I'll come to your house tomorrow, the verb expresses a deliberate intention (or promise) to come, but I'll be coming to your house tomorrow expresses no intention (simple prediction).
We can add to these sentecnes to make the distinction cleare:r
i I'll come to your house tomorrow, so we can discuss the matter.
ii I'll be coming to your house tomorrow, so we can discuss the matter.
In i, I had not thought of coming to your house before, but I want to discus this matter; therefore I will come. In ii, I was going to come to your house in any case for reasons not connected with this matter.
Since I am coming, we can discuss the matter.
Note also the negative forms:He won't come (=he refuses to come). He won't be coming (= a statement of fact; perhaps he's ill, or away).
Pattern drill
1 What will you be doing this time next year? Asking about a fact, not about intention.
Compare:I am writing a short story now (at this present time). I shall be writing a novel this time next year.
2 It's raining again. - I hope it won't still be raining tomorrow. Parallel use of the present and future continuous. Still emphasizes continuity.
3 I shall go to the station tomorrow. The simple future expresses intention.
I'll be seeing you then. I'll be going there too. The future continuous states the fact:I'll be there, so I'll be seeing you. Note that the response:I shall go there too here would alter the sense to:I shall go because I want to (see you).
4 We'll probably be writing them all day. A statement of fact. All day emphasizes the duration of the action.
I'm afraid so. Note this use of so, replacing the phr‘astehat is what’(I'm afraid of).
Compare:I believe so, I think so, I hope so, etc.
Repetition drill

Key structures:The past perfect
a The past perfect and the simple past are here used in patterns involving the conjunctions after, as soon as,when, etc.
b When two or more past events are described in the order in which they occurred, the past perfect tense is not usually necessary.
The children (1) broke the window and (2) ran away.
But if the first action is mentioned after the second, the past perfect will make this clear:
The children (2) ran away after (1) they had broken the window. c The past perfect is sometimes used even when the correct

order of events is given:
When he had finished lunch, he asked for a glass of water. Thiscouldequallywellbeexpressed:aWsherehefinishedlunch,
he asked⋯
In such cases, the past perfect serves to emphasize the
completion of the first action before the start of the second; it is frequently used in this way after as soon as and after.
Pattern drill
1 I hadn't prepared lunch for him. This refers to the time before he got angry.
2 I hadn't taken my glasses with me. i.e. I forgot to take my glasses (from the house) before I got to the cinema.
3 Because he'd already done it. i.e. at some time before yesterday. Note the use of already with the past perfect (Compare with the present perfect, KS 4 and 5).
4 I realized it as soon as I'd burnt it. First I burnt it (it = the letter) and then I realized it (it = burning the letter was a mistake).

Key structures:Indirect statements
a The verbs say and tell often introduce reported speech. Tell must always be followed by an indirect object.
The conjunction that is optional, and is nearly always omitted in spoken English. He tells me/ says (that) he's busy.
b Sequence of tenses :at this early level only the basic principles need be taught. These are:
i When the introductory verb is in the present, there is no tense change in the reported statement.
ii When the introductory verb is in the past, the following changes are necessary:
simple present becomes simple past; present perfect becomes past perfect; simple past becomes past perfect.
However, in spoken English the simple past is often left unchanged, provid ed this does not cause confusion about the

relative times of the actions (see KS 14 in this book). Modals:shall/ will become would; can becomes could; may
becomes might.
would, should, ought, might, could do not normally change. must does not normally change unless the obligation is
fulfilled by the time the speech is reported; in this case it becomes had to.
c Time references and pronoun changes must be made according to the statement:
(direct speech) Mr. Wort:h I can see you tomorrow, Miss Casey.
(reported speech) Mr. Worth told Miss Casey (that) he could see her the next day.
Pattern drill
1 No change in tense in the statement because says is present tense. Note the elisions:doctor's ('s = is) and Mr. Green's ('s
= has).
2 Said is in the pastense, so tenses in the statements must change.
3 Says/ think are present so no change in the tense of broke. In S2 response, I and Mary should be stressed for contrast.
4 Present perfect becomes past perfect after said. Note the elisions:There's been (= There has been) and There'd been (= There had been). These elided forms should always be used in spoken English.
Repetition drill
Chorus, group or individual repetition

Key structures:Type 1 conditional statements
a
If + present tense, with future tense in the main clause. Note that shall/ will may NOT be used in the-icflause in:If it rains, we shall stay at home. This type of conditional sentence implies that the action in the if-clause will probably take place.
    Other modals may be used in place of shall/ will in the main

clause:
If it rains, we can/ must/ may/ ought to stay at home.
b
i The main clause may contain an imperative, in which case
the statement may apply to the present or the future, depending on the context.
ii Notice the last sentence in the te:xt‘If you receive⋯, you cannot fail ⋯’
When the present tense is used in both clauses, the statenmt is a general one:
If the condition is fulfilled, the action always takes place.
Compare the sentence in a above wi:thIf it rains, we (always) stay at home.
Pattern drill
1 You'll miss ⋯ /⋯ I'll go by taxi. Note that 'll is used for both will and shall.
2 Shall I⋯? An offer, meanin:g Do you want me to⋯? Notice the particle to at the end of S2 response.
3 What'll ⋯ This contracted form /'watl/ should be practised in speaking.
Notice that in S2:I'm sure he WILL sell it, ‘will’ keeps its full form because it is stressed (for emphasis after:⋯ if he doesn't sell it).
In I'll sell it myself, the stress is on my SELF (in contrast to he).
4 Practice with the negative imperative + condition. In S2, won't could be used instead of shan't.

Key structures:Must and Have to
a
i Strictly, must implies obligation from the speaker's point of view:
Imustleavenow(I'vestayedtoolong).Yousmtuhelpher(I think you must).
ii Have (got) to implies a necessity imposed by some outside influence:
I have to/ I've got to leave now (because my train leaves in five minutes).
hospital
the office
London
the country

Note that have got to is a colloquial form and the contraction is always used. In practice, must is often used instead of have (got) to, though the reverse is rare. In the negative, the two forms are NEVER interchangeable (see KS 41).
iii Must often remains unchanged in reported speech (see KS 15, note ii in this book).
Compare:He said he must/ would have to leave early (i.e. he hasn't left yet).
He said he had to leave early (i.e. He left before the report was made).
b
Must cannot express necessity in the past. It is replaced by had to. Shall/ will have to expresses necessity in the future.
c
Must + infinitive can express deduction (about the present) from known facts:
She has a son of twenty, so she must be over forty.
The light is still on, so he must still be awake/ reading. Deduction about a past action is expresed by must + perfect
infinitive:
‘Which way did he go’? -- ‘Here are his footprints. He must
have come this way.’
Pattern drill
1 Have you really got to go now? Note that we could also :say Do you have to go? The question for:mHave you to go? is rare (and very formal).
I'm afraid I've got to. I have to ⋯. The two forms are interchangeable, but note that there is no contraction in I have to⋯
2 Must you go now? i.e. Can't you change your mind?
I'mafraidso(i.e.I'mafraidImu.stI)havetomeetmyhusband. Have to indicates a previous arrangement which cannot be altered.
3 I doubt it (i.e. I doubt if she'll go with you). She had to go ⋯ Had to for necessity in the past.
4 He must be mad to⋯ today! i.e. The weather is so batdoday that only a mad person would fly/ climb, etc.
Must is used for deduction.
He had to pick up a sick sailor. Had to indicates necessity in the past.

Key structures:Have (possession/ ordinary verb)
a Have is an auxiliary verb used in forming the present perfect and past perfect tenses (KS 4, 14).
b When it is not an auxiliary verb, have can show possess:ion
He has/ He's got a new house. (Note the contracted form with have got.)
Have got is used more commonly than have on its own in spoken British English (in formal writing have got should be avoided).
In American English, do/ does are used with have to form questions and negatives and this usage is common in British English too:
Have you a pen? I haven't a pen. (rare)
Have you got a pen? I haven't got a pen. (common British usage)

Do you have a pen? I don't have a pen. (common Am/ Br usage)
c Have can be used in place of another verb to mean take, experience, receive, eat, etc.
I had a bath (= took); I had a good holiday (= experience).
Note that have is commonly used in the sense o‘ftake’ when offering something:Have a cigarette/ cup of tea/ slice of cake, etc. A more polite form would be:Would you like to have ⋯?
Pattern drill
1 You can have it if you want it. i.e. you can take and keep it.
2 Have you got the tickets? -I had them a minute ago. Have you got in questions contrasted with had (possession).
3 He's the man who has five cars. Simple possession. Note also must (deduction, KS 17).
4 Have you had a card from John yet? Have is used simultaneously as an auxiliary and as a main verb her e (in the present perfect of have).
I have a card/ I had a meal:here, had means received/ ate.

my car
Can you tell me if the police found my car
found it, but they haven't mentioned it.
(44 words) a Can/ could/ may/ might can be usde to request permission.
Key structures:Can and May

Can is usual among friends and equals; could and may are both common ‘polite’ forms; might suggests hesitation, trying to be very polite (as to one's superior).
b May/ might + infinitive can express possibility or conjecture about the present or future.
May suggests a stronger possibility than might:
He may come tomorrow (it's quite likely that he will come).
He might come tomorrow (it's possible, but rather doubtful). May/ might + perfect infinitive refer to a past event:
He may have telephoned last night (I don't know, but it's quite
likely).
He might have telephoned last night (it's possible, but I doubt
it).
c May/ might as well + infinitive can be used interchangeably
to suggest that one course of action is as good b(aodr) as anothe:r I may/ might as well come with you (as stay at hom-eit makes
no difference).
Pattern drill
1 May is used in a polite request. Either can or may could be used in both the request and the reply, the only differenicneg be that may is more polite.
2 Might is used in a slightly hesitant request (i.e. I'm afraid you will be angry if I disturb you). Note that might can never be used in a (short) reply to such a request.
3 He may have telephoned, i.e. it is quite likeltyhat he did telephone.
4 As in 3, conjecture about the past, but with a feeling of doubt (i.e. if they had found your car, surely they would have mentioned it?).

(47 words)
Key structures:The gerund after prepositions
a The gerund (verb-ing) may be used as a noun and can be the subject of a sentence when the action is considered in a general sense. The infinitive may also be used in this way, but it is usually preceded by it.
Compare:Driving fast is dangerous. To drive fast is dangerous (rare). It is dangerous to drive fast.
b When a verb follows immediately after a preposition, the gerund must be used:

He's keen on cycling. She's afraid of staying late in the shop.
Note that when to is part of an infinitive, it is not a preposition:I object to paying twice.
c
i Note the use of without, after, before + gerund in joining sentences:he left without paying.
ii Compare:I must apologize for interrupting you (at this moment).
I must apologize for having interrupted you (some time ago).
Compare also:After looking/having looked at his watch, he hurried away.
Here there is no difference between the two forms, since it is obvious that one action must have been completed before the other.
Now compare:He congratulated me on winning/having won the competition.
Here, on winning perhaps suggests more immediate congratulations.
iii On + gerund:On hearing the nesw, she fainted. = When she heard the news, she fainted.
Note that sentences beginning with on/after + gerund are more usual in written than in spoken English.
iv Note the position of not in:I apologize for not letting you know earlier.
Pattern drill
1 I'm keen on walking. Adjective + preposition + gerund. 2 Give up smoking:gerund after give up (SD 18).
3 ⋯ without getting bored. The gerund after without.
4 Note the construction :congratulate someone on doing
something.
The exclamation Congratulations! is often used by itself. In
reported speech this would becom:eI congratulated him (on getting a job).

Key structures:Word order in compound statements
a The usual word order in simple statements is (T)/S/V/O/M/P/(T). (KS 1 b, c)
b Compound statements may be formed by joining simple
statements together with coordinating conjunctions.
i Note that when the two parts of a compound statement are
at last

joined by and or but and share a common subject, it is not always necessary to repeat the subject (or the subject + modal/auxili:ary)
He finished lunch and (he) went into the garden.
You must wash the dishes and (you must) sweep the floor. ii The coordinating conjunctions both ⋯ and, either ⋯ or
and neither ⋯ nor may be used to join two subjects, two objects or two verbs:
He teaches English and 1 teach English. = Both he and I teach English.
He plays soccer, or perhaps he plays rugby. = He plays either soccer or rugby.
He cannot read and he cannot write. = He can neither read nor write.
Note that this use of neither⋯ nor is not common in spoken English, compare:He can't read or write.
iii Not only ⋯ bur ⋯ as well/also may be used in place of both ⋯ and when special emphasis is required:
You must not only wash the dishes but sweep the floor as well/but also sweep the floor.
Note again that this is used in writing rather than in speech. Compare:You must wash the dishes and sweep the floor too.
Pattern drill

We can't both eat it. Note the position of both between the modal and the verb.
NEVER ‘We both can't eat it.’
4 Did either of them go to the fil-mN?o, neither of them went to it. Note the use of either of in questions and neither of in negative statements with reference to two. All of/none of are used when referring to more than two.

Key to Letter writing
The third address is correct (as a letter heading).
Key structures:The present, simple and continuous: Stative verbs
a Refer back to KS 2.
b The simple present is used in general statements about what is always true:
The earth goes round the sun. Horses are animals.
c Verbs of perception such as:see, hear, etc., and stative

verbs (i.e. the activity they describe cannot be stopped or started at will) such as:like, know, etc., are not usually used in the continuous tenses, e.g. I hear (=understand) that you like classical music.
Compare : I am listening (a voluntary activity), but I can't/don't hear anything.
Note also that some of these verbs can bsedu in the continuous tense to convey a different, dynamic meaning:
Compare:I can see very well without glasses (see = verb of perception).
I'm seeing him tomorrow (=I'm going to meet him).
Pattern drill
1 I think (that) he's lying. Think here means ‘believe’: stative verb.
I'm sure he is (lying). He often lies. The simple present (lies) is contrasted with the present continuous (is lying).
2 He's driving it, but he doesn't own it:contrast between dynamic verbs in the continuous present and stative verbs.
3 Fish lay eggs:the simple present shows what is always true. Note the use of the auxiliary do in S2:I do/ they do/it does.
4 Verbs of perception and other stative verbs are contrasted with dynamic verbs expressing an effort to perceive (e.g. wecan see without making any effort, but looking requires an effort).

Key structures:The present perfect simple (Since and

flown that plane

For)
a For the use of just, already and yet with the present perfect see KS 4.
b For used with the present perfect indicates a period of time:
Tim has been abroad for three years (and is still there). For can sometimes be omitted:I've been here an hour.
c Since is used with a point of time and means ‘from that
time up to the present’.
It is always used with a perfect tense and can never be om:itted Tim has been abroad since January (and is still there).
Note that the‘point of time’ may be a clause containing a
past tense:
Ever since he moved in, he has had trouble (Text, 11.2-3).
d The present perfect is often used with phrases like up till
now and so far (meaning‘from an indefinite time in the past up to the present’) to describe repeated actions:
Up till now he's always passed his exams (but can he pass this next one?).
I've been to New York three times so far (and I'll probably go again).
Pattern drill
1 He's one of the ugliest men (that) I've e ver seen. The present perfect with ever is commonly used in a relative clause after a superlative (that is usually omitted). Compare Lesson 8, PD 4.
    2  What an ugly man! (SD 2)
Yes, I've never seen such an ugly man before! Note the use of such + a/an + dajective + noun. The article is omitted in the pl:ural What noisy people!- Yes, I've never met such noisy people before! (See SD 35)
3 How long have you known him-?I've known him since childhood. The present perfect is used with for (+ period of timea)nd since (+ point of time). Note that the present tense can never be used here.

Key structures:The indefinite and definite articles
a
Some is generally used in affirmative statements (KS 6).
Any is used with uncountable nouns and plural countable nouns
in questions:
Is there ANY milk in the bottle? Are there ANY nails in the
tin?
and in negative statements:
There isn't ANY milk in the bottle. There aren't ANY nails in
the tin. b
Articles are not generally used before names of people, countries, etc. (KS 6).

Key to Letter writing
The second heading is correct.

Key structure:The past continuous and ‘Used to’
The past continuous describes an action in progress at a given time in the past (KS 7).
Used to + infinitive describes an action or a state which was ‘habitual’ in the past but has not continued in the present. Compare the following:
I used to go to work by bus, but I go by car now (i.e. both habits, past and present).
I was going to work when I had the accident (i.e. at a specific time in the past).
I worked in a factory for three years during the war (in a specific period of time).
Note that I used to collect stamps is an acceptable sentence on its own and states implicitly that I no longer collect stamps.
The sentence:I collected stamps is not acceptable since it needs a time reference, e.g. when I was a boy. It does not tell us whether ‘I’ still collect stamps or not.
Used to is preferred to the simple past + time reference when past and present habits are contrasted.
Compare:I used to live with my grandparents, but I have my own home now.
I lived with my grandparents until I went to college.
In formal writing, the negative form is (I) used not ⋯to and the interrogative is Used (you) to ⋯ ?
However, in conversational English the forms didn't use to (NOT didn't used to) and Did you use to ⋯. ? are more widely used.
Pattern drill
1 The continuous aspect of the actions is emphasized here.
2 It was just beginning to rain when ⋯:Note that it was beginning ⋯ when suggests a‘gradual’ or slow start to something which continues as a background to the action described by the simple past.
3 I used to, but I don't any longer. Used to is contrasted with the simple present.
Note the use of the particle to in the short response (= I used to collect them).
4 Did you really? - Did you really use to be one? Note the rising intonation on really to show surprise.

b The infinitive itself may become passive when a passive

meaning is intended:
Compare:He never expected them to find the bicycle (= He never
expected that they would find the bicycle).
He neverexpected the bicycle to be found (= He never expected
that the bicycle would be found).

Key to Letter writing
St., Rd., Ave., Sq., Pl., N. Y., W.B., S.W.3.
Key structures:The simple future and‘Going to’
a

The present continuous of go + t-oinfinitive is used in place
of the simple future to express intention. It usually suggests that preparations have been made and the action is therefore very likely to take place.
b
Note that the going to future can be used wit expression:
hout a time
I am going to travel by air.
He is going to sell his car.
In this case it usually refers to the immediate or near future. c
It can also be used with a time expression:
He is going to sell his car tomorrow/next week.
They are going to move to a new house next month/next year.
d
The going to form may be used in place of a verb which directly
expresses intention:
I intend to/I'm going to write to him.
e
The going to form cannot replace the simple future in type 1
conditions:
You'll enjoy yourself if you travel by air.
It does not usually replace the simple future with time clauses,
though it may do so if the speaker wishes to emphasize the intention:
‘You can't write to him’.‘Oh yes, I can! I'm going to write to him as soon as I get home.’
Pattern drill
    1  What do you intend to do? or What are you going to do?
2 He's decided not to (i.e. not to tidy the garden). He has decided that he is not going to tidy the garden because he has arranged to/is going to sell the house.
3 I'll bring some food. Will is used here in the sense of ‘promise to’. The going to future cannot be used in this sense.
4 I'll read the map while you drive. The simple future + time clause. Note that the simple present replaces will in the time clause (see also Text, line 7:‘he will ⋯ as she swims’). For future examples, see KS 60
Repetition drill

to to express intention and certainty. T:Listen. Do not speak.

Key structures:The future perfect simple
a
For the use of the future continuous, see KS 13.
b
The future perfect is formed with will/shall + have + past
participle. Thistenseisusedforanactionwhich,atagiventeiminthe
future, will already be completed (and therefore in the past). Look at the following:
They will have finished the bridge in a year's time. i.e. They are building it now; they will finish it within a year; therefore, a year from now they will have finished it.
He will have moved into a new flat in two months' time. i.e. He hasn't moved yet; he will move before three months have passed; therefore, in three months' time he will have moved.
Note that a time reference must be given with the futurfecpte tense. Time expressions commonly used ar:ein + period of time (in a month's time); this time + exact time (this time tomorrow, this time next week); by (= before) + exact time (by next Friday, by this time tomorrow).
Pattern drill
1 Will you stillbe writing⋯ at six?- No, I'll have written it by then (i.e. by six, some time before six). The future continuous and the future perfect are contrasted.
2 They've started to build the stadium-. I hope they'll have finished it in time for the Games. Th e present perfect and the future perfect are contrasted. Note in time for an event = before the event is due to take place.
3 I'll paint it for you. The simple future is used to express a promise.

Key structures:The past perfect simple
a
The past perfect has already been taught in patterns involving the use of after, as soon as, when and until (KS 14).
broken a glass
written a book
driven a car

Note the constructions with no sooner ⋯ than and hardly ⋯ when (SD 38).
Text 11.4-5:He had NO SOONER returned THAN he bought⋯ can also be expressed as:As soon as he (had) returned, he bought⋯ And 11.9-10:He had HARDLY had time to settle down WHEN he sold ⋯ can be expressed a:s He had only just setteld down when⋯
b
i The past perfect may be used in patterns involving befo:re He had lived in Scotland for fifteen years before he came to
England.
However, the simple past would be equally correct here, since
the actions are described in the order of their occurrence: He lived in Scotland for fifteen years before he came to
England.
The past perfect in the first sentence merely emphasizes that
the first action was completed before the second began. Compare:Before he came to England, he had lived (or lived)
in Scotland for fifteen years:even in this sentence, the use and meaning of before make it possible to use the simple past for the second action, but the past perfect is clearer and probably preferred in written English.
ii For the use of the past perfect in indirect statements, see KS 15.
He has never run away before. She said he had never run away before.
Note that before is an adverb here, meaning in the past, previously.
Pattern drill
1 Because I hadn't won it:i.e. before it was offered tome.
2 Again? I didn't know she'd ever broken it before. Note the tense sequence in the indirect statement. Again+'/gen/ is stressed, with rising intonation, to show surprise. Note the use of ever (= at any time) with before for emphasis.
3 The simple past and the past perfect are contrasted.

Key structures:Indirect questions
a The sequence of tenses in indirect questions follows the same rules as those for indirect statements (KS 15).
Note the word order in the indirect questions:
‘Are you tired?’ she asked. She asked if you were tired.
b When there is a wh- question word (when, why, etc.) in the
direct question, this is used in the indirect question:
‘When will Jack arrive’? Tom asked. Tom asked when Jack would
arrive. If there is no question word, either if or whether must be used:
Mary asked if you had been abroad. Mary asked whether you had been abroad.
c When the question contains an a lternative (with or), whether is usually preferred to if:
They asked me if/whether I was ill.
They asked me whether I was ill or just lazy.
Pattern drill
1 I wonder if he's sold the house-.I asked if he'd sold i⋯t Note the sequence of tenses:present perfect after I wonder
(present tense) and past perfect after I asked (past tense). 2 The past perfect is used in indirect statements and
questions.
She didn't tell me whether she had or n:oti. e. whether she'd
met John or not. The contraction she'd is not possible when the main verb is omitted. Note whether⋯ or(not).
3 They didn't tell me when they'd come. Indirect questions with when. Note that here they'd=they would.
4 Indirect questions with why.
Our teacher asked why Tom dind't come to the party. Do you know why? (i. e. why he didn't come?)-I've no idea why he didn't come. Note that‘the party’is equivalent to a time reference(i. e.
the party last night; both speakers know when it was). It is therefore not necessary to use t he past perfect after asked. Compare:‘Why hasn't Tom come to the party(tonight’)?-She asked me why Tom hadn't come to the party.

Key structures:Type 2 conditional statements

weryeou. The roads are too busy. sea

a For Type 1 conditional sentences (if + present tense + will/shall) see KS 16.
b Type 2 conditional sentences use if + past tense + would/should (could/might).
There is no difference in time between Types 1 and2, but in Type 2
i the action in the if-clause is unlikely to happen;
ii the action in the i-fclause is contrary to known facts and therefore cannot be fulfilled.
Compare the following:
If you go to the exhibition, you will enjoy it. (Type 1, Ik thin you may go.)
If you went to the exhibition, you would enjoy it. (Type 2, i. You might go but I suppose you are unlikely to go.)
If I were in London now, I would go to the exhibition. (Type 2, ii. But I am not in London now, so I cannot go-an impossible condition.)
Note that in Type 2 conditions, were may be used instead of was. Were is more usual than was when the condition is contrary to the known facts (see b ii above:)He would help you if he were here (but he isn't).
Note also tha‘t If I were yo,u I'd⋯’is a useful way of offering advice:
If I were you/If I were in your position, I would act differently.
Pattern drill
1 I'd (= I would) go to it if she asked me to (i.e. if she asked me to go). The action in the if -clause is possible, but unlikely.
Note that the particle to implies the infinitive of the verb in the main clause, which is not repeated.
2 Would you hit him if he told you to (i.e. told you to hit him)?
As in Pattern drill 1, but the question form is practised.
3 I would drive if the roads weren't so busy (but they are busy, so I shan't drive).
Would is stressed; without stress, we would s:ayI'd drive⋯.

Key structures:Must, Have to and Need
a For the use of must and have (got) to in affirmative sentences, see KS 17.
b Need (=require) is an ordinary verb when followed by an object, i.e. it takes-s in the third person singular and is used with do/does in the negative and interrogativ:e He needs/doesn't need a haircut. Does he need a haircut?
c
i Needn't + verb (infinitive without to) does not tak-es in the third person singular and forms the negative without do/do:es He needn't wait for me.
Needn't + have + past participle refers to a past action: You needn't have waited for me.
Note that this implie:s You did wait for me although it wasn't
necessary.
ii Don't have to (or don't need to) may be used instead of
needn't and is usually used when a habitual action is rrerfed to: I have a car, so I don't have to/don't need to use the buses
(needn't would be unusual here).
Didn't have to + infinitive refers to a past action (which may
or may not be habitual):
He had his own car, so I didn't have to wait for him. Notet tha
this means:I did not wait because it was not necessary. Compare:Why did you wait? You didn't have to. (=You needn't
have waited.)
d Needn't/don't have to/haven't got to all show the absence
of necessity, but mustn't is a prohibition (a negative commadn): You mustn't make a noise. (= Do not make a noise. I forbid it.) You needn't/don't have to come if you don't want to. (i.e. It's
not necessary for you to come, so please yourself.)
Pattern drill
1 I don't really need any/one. Note the use of do(n')t with need + object.
2 I must phone the doctor.- You needn't bother (i.e. bother to phone the doctor).
Needn't is used to remove the obligation expressed by must.
3 I didn't have to wait for her. i.e. It wasn't necessary (for me to wait), so I didn't wait.
Note that in the second part of S2 the pronouns are stressed to emphasize that what happened was the opposite of what was expected.
4 You mustn't smoke (i.e. Don't smoke!). Prohibition.
You needn't have told me that. You told me, but it wasn't necessary.

Key structures:Have (ordinary verb)
a For have/have got (possession) and have = receive, take, eat, etc., see KS 18.
b Have + noun may replace a verb with the same root form as the noun. In some cases, the verb gives a greater sense oufrpose or emphasizes the nature of the action. Compare:
I walked to work (i.e. I didn't drive or go by bus).
I went for a long walk this morning (i.e. that's how I spent the time).
Look at the blackboard! (i.e. Pay attention!)
I think there's someone ta the door. Will you have a look? (i.e. Just go and see if anyone's there.) Note that have a bath/wash often replaces ‘bath/wash oneself’.
She bathed the baby.
She had a bath (i.e. She bathed herself).
Pattern drill
1 Have some more soup! Have is comnmly used in the imperative
for offering something. The polite form would be Would you like (to have) ⋯?
2 I thought he took sugar in his tea. Note the past tense in the indirect statement. He does, usually (or He usually does). But he's having tea without sugar today.
Note that have can be used in the present continuous when it means take, eat etc.

Key to Summary writing
The American explorer, R.E. Byrd, became the first man to fly over the South Pole in 1929. He took a lot of photographs during the flight but then he ran into difficulties. His plane could not get over the mountains so he ordered his men to throw out two heavy food sacks. The plane then flew over the mountains and continued without further trouble.

Key structures:Can and Be able to
a
Can/could may be used to request or grant permission (KS 19, a).
b
iCanmaybeusedtoexpressabilyitinthe(immediate)future when it has the meaning:‘be free’ or ‘be in a position’ to do something:
Icanseeyoutomorrow.Notethatthisme:anIsaminaposition now to tell you that I shall be free tomorrow.
Generally speaking, future ability is experssed by shall/will be able to.
ii Note the tense sequence (see KS 15) in indirect statements.
iii Could/was able to expresses learned ability in the pa:st I could/was able to swim when I was five.
They also combine with stative verbs (understand, see,hear, etc.) to express the equivalent of the simple past tense. Comp:are He had a strong accent, but I could/was able to understand him./I understood him.
c
When the ability refers to the successful completion of a past action (in spite of difficulties),could may NOT be used. Compare the following:
She could/was able to swim when she was five years old (= learned ability in the past).
She swam the Channel when she was eleven (= statement of fact; swim is a dynamic verb).
The weather was bad, but sheswable to swim the Channel (Could is not possible here).
Note that in the negative, i.e. when an action was NOT completed, either couldn't or wasn't able to may be used:
He couldn't/wasn't able to go to London yesterday because his wife was ill.
Pattern drill
1 Can is used in the sense of‘am free to’ or ‘I know I shall be free to⋯’
2 Can the baby walk yet? Can expresses ability in the present.
He'll be able to walk in a few months' time. Future ability is expressed by will be able to; can may not be used.
3 I could swim by the time I was three. Past ability. I was

able to swim ⋯ is also correct, but could is usually preferred when both forms are possible.
4 It's a pity he couldn't see the play. Or he wasn't able to.
He was able to see it afterall. ie. He DID see it. (See used
as a dynamic verb expressing the successful completion of an action in spite of difficulty.) Could may not be used.

Key structures:The gerund and the infinitive
a
For the gerund as a subject, or after (adjective +) preposition, see KS 20.
b
The gerund may follow a verb + preposition, eg. look forward to/be used to⋯.
I'm Looking forward to seeing him. I'm used to getting up early. c
After the verbs start, begin and continue either the infinitive
or the gerund may be used without any difference in meani:ngThey started to run/running.
d
The verbs love, like (= enjoy), hate and prefer:
i When used in the past or present these verbs are usually
followed by the gerund, especially when we wish to i‘mpallyways’: I like fishing/swimming, etc.
The infinitive is also possible, but it is morelikely to be used with reference to a particular momen:tI hate to disturb you (just now) but may I come in?
Note that when like means ‘think it right or wise ’, the infinitive is always used:
I like to answer letters quickly (it is right to do this). Compare:I like answering letters (I enjoy doing it).
ii When these verbs are in the conditional, they are usually
followed by the infinitive:
I'd love/like to help you. I can stay, but I'd prefer to go
home. e
Want and need are followed by the gerund in sentences like:
That shirt needs mending/wants washing (i.e. someone should mend/wash it).
Pattern drill
1 ⋯instead of living here? Gerund after prepositional phrase instead of.
I prefer living here to living abroa:d Note the two gerunds. The infinitive is never used here since it would produ:ceI prefer to live here to to live⋯.
2 Shall we play tennis, or would you prefer to rest? Note shall used for a suggestion and the infinitive after prefer in the conditional. The question could be rephrase:dWould you prefer to play tennis or to rest?
3 I started to stud:ythe gerund (studying) could also be used

here.
That's no excuse for not studying:the gerund is used after
noun + preposition.
Note the negative construction.
4 The gerund is practised after need and hate. Repetition drill

Key structures:The passive
a
The following uses of the passive are revised:
in the present, simple past and present perfect (KS 10); with the modals can, must, will, etc. (KS 21);
with verbs which take an object + to-infinitive (KS 34).
b
Note the form of the passive in the past perfec:t HAD + BEEN
+ PAST PARTICIPLE:
Compare I found out that someone had sent the parcel to the
wrong address and
I found out that the parcel had been sent to the wrong address. Compare He told me that the police had arrested the thief and He told me that the thief had been arrested (by the police) Again, by + agent is only necessary for purposes of
identification.
Pattern drill
1 Was the car ever found? Simple past (passi)v.e Note the use of ever(= at any time).
Yes, it had been left in a car park. Past perfect (passive) because this action took place before the car was found.
2 The wallet hasn't been returned yet. Present perfect (passive) with not ⋯ yet.
⋯ we expect itto be returned any day now. Passive infinitive after expect.
Note any day now = today, tomorrow or the next day, etc.
3 I've been told to pay the rent. i.e. Someone told me to pay the rent.
It's already been paid. Present perfect (passive). Note the position of already.
It must have been paid by someone else. Must have + past participle showing deduction about a past action. Note that by + agent is necessary here, but compare:
It's already been paid. John must have paid it. The active voice is preferred when the agent is a named person.
4 I thought it had been paid by your secretary. The present perfect (passive) becomes past perfect (passive) in reported speech. The agent is again included for the purpose of identification.

1 There aren't many students who speak ⋯ . The relative pronoun who is used as a subject and therefore cannot be omitted (SD 28).
2 He says he's too ill to do any work. Too + adjective + to-infinitive (SD 29 and 85).
Compare:He's so ill that he cannot work (see Pattern drill 3). Note that very cannot be used.
Then he must be very ill! Must is used for deduction.
3 It was so badly torn (that) she couldn't mend it. So + adjective + (that-) clause (SD 35).
Note that the conjunction that is usually omitted in spoken English.
What a naughty boy/What naughty boys! Note the use of a with the singular noun (SD 2).

in his life. He slept on the roof of his house because the weather was hot. Three nihgts later, the bed was swept off the roof during a storm. The man was not only unhurt but still on his mattress.
As the bed was in pieces, he carried his mattress indoors and after he had put it on the floor he went back to sleep.

Key structures:Word order in complex statements
a For word order in simple and compound sentences, see KS 1 and 25.
b In complex sentences, at least one clause is made subordinate to the main clause. The most usual way of doing this is by using one of the varioussubordinating conjunctions:when, until, after, before, as soon as, while(time);because, as
fell asleep. move

since(reason); though, although(concession); who, which, that, etc.(relative);and to, in order to, etc., see also SD 59(purpose).
e. g .He missed the train(=main cl ause)BECAUSE he did not hurry(=subordinate clause of reason).
Note that a comma is generally used when the subordinate clause comes first:
ALTHOUGH he ran fast, he failed to win the race.
c So + adverb/adjective and such + adjective +noun are followed by a that-clause(of result):
I was so tired THAT I went to sleep immediately. Note that that is often omitted.
Compare : I was very tired AND went to sleep immediately(=compound sentence).
d A present participle can replace a subject + verb when one action is followed closely by another which has the same subject. The participle must come first:
Finding the door unlocked I went into the kitchen.(See also Text,1.10)
If the two actions occur simultaneously, the participle can come before or after the mainverb:(Screaming for help,) She ran out of the house(screaming for help).
Similarly, a past participle may replace a subject + passive verb, though this is very rare in spoken Engl:isDhestroyed during the war(i. e .it was destroyed), the city has now been rebuilt.
Pattern drill
1 I fell asleep reading it:i.e. I fell asleep while I was reading it. Note that a participle used in this way mu‘stbelong’ to the subject of the main verb.
Compare:The child fell asleep while his mother was reading to him.
2 I saved up for weeks to buy it. The infinitive expresses purpose(to = in order to).
3 Why did he miss the train? He ran, didn't he? Note that the question tag has a rising intonation(asking for confirmation)
Yes, but he missed it, even though he ran. Even is used with though for emphasis.
Compare:Although he ran, he missed it(=statement of fact).
Even though he ran, he missed it. (showing great surprise that he missed it).
4 She was tired, wasn't she? The question tag has a falling intonation here(it is a statement of fact rather than a question).
She was so tired (that)she fell asleep. So + adjective + that-clause. The drill could be done first using that and later omitting it. It would usually be omitted in spoken English.

But it can be used in the present continuous if it expresses a l-osntganding hope that something may or may not happen:He's been waiting to hear from them for months and he's still hoping(that)they'll contact him.
Pattern drill
1Lookathim!He'skickingthedo-gI.refusetolookatanyone who kicks dogs.
A contrast is drawn between he's kicking(i. e. now, at the moment of speaking)and anyone who kicks(i. e. who makes a habit
of kicking).Refuse is a stative verb and therefore not usually used in the continuous forms.
2 Why are you buying a Ford(i. e. now)?-Why don't you buy a Fiat? The simple present is used to make a suggestion.
I prefer Fords. Prefer is a stative verb.
3 Why on earth is she buying that hat(i. e. now)?-I expect
she likes it. Expect is a stative verb when it means think, suppose and is followed by a that-clause.
4 I'm expecting her to arrive any minute no.w When expect is used in the present continuous it is similar to wait for and takes a direct object. Compar:e I expect(that)she'll arrive soon(expect
= think, suppose; see Pattern drill 3).
It is possible to sa:y I expect her(to arrive)any minute now, but the continuous form is probably more usual and makes ‘her arrival’ seem more definite.

Key structures : The present perfect, simple and continuous
a Both the simple and continuous forms otfhe present perfect can describe an action which began in the past and still continues or has only just finished. When a time expression with for or since is used, both forms may be possible:
He has worked/has been working here for ten years/since he was a boy.
b When the simple form is used without a time expression, it refers to a single completed action :I've painted the sitting room(I've completed the job). Compare:What have you been doing all day?-I've been painting the sitting room(I may or may nohtave completed the job, I'm only telling you what I've been doing).
c The simple present perfect may describe a repeated acti:on He's rung me up five times today(i. e. on five separate occasions). The continuous form here would emphasize the continuity o f the action:He's been ringing me up all day(i. e. the phone has hardly stopped ringing).
Pattern drill
1 You look upset. What've you been doing? The present perfect continuous indicates that an action has been in progress for some time(up till a short time ago) and the effects of the action can still be seen(You look upset).
2 Have you finished that book already! Note that this is not a question, since it is obvious tha‘tyou've already finished the book’. It is an exclamation of surprise(Compa:rHeave you finished that book yet?).
3 Have they been taking their exams-?Yes, they have. They've taken five of them so far. i. e. Five have been completed up till mow and there are still more to take.
The continuous and simple forms of the present perfect are contrasted.
4 Why hasn't she rung John up yet?-What do you mean?(i. e. What a silly question!)
She's been ringing him up all morning. The simple and continuous forms are again contrasted.

Now that firemen have put out a big forest fire in California,
they have been trying to discover its cause. There was no evidence that it was started by broken glass or a cigarette end. However
a fireman has just solved the mystery. He noticed the remains of
a snake which had been dropped by a bird on to some electric wires. In winding itself round the wires, the snake had sent sparks to the ground and this caused the fire.

Key structures:The indefinite and definite articles a
Some and any are used before plural and uncountable nouns(KS 30a).
b
The may be used before an adjective to represent a class of people:e. g. the rich ( = all rich people), the poor( = alploor people), the blind ( = all blind people), etc.
Note that the adjective becomes a collective, invariable noun (we cannot add-s), but the following verb and any related pronoun will be plural:
Therichshouldhelpthepoorbutunfortunatelytheytdohne'lp them often enough.
c
A few nouns (representing places or buildings which have a specific purpose) are used without an article when the building or place is visited or used for its main purpose. For example, we go to school/to college/to university/to study, to hospital when we are ill, to bed to sleep, to work as workers, to prison as prisoners, to church to worship God. The phrase go to market is used for the farmer who buys or sells animals, etc. , not for the housewife who does her shopping at the market or the shops.

Key structures:The past continuous, ‘Used to’ and ‘Would’
a
For the use of the past continuous (with when, while, just as)see KS 7.
For used to+infinitive, indicating a discontinued action, see KS 31.
b
Used to may refer to a definite aspt time and describe a past routine with no direct or implied contrast with the present:e.
g. Have you always liked walking-?Yes，I remember when I was young I often used to go for long walks on my own. Here, the speaker's present habits are irrelevant (eh may or may not still go for long walks on his own, although the question implies that he does). In this kind of sentence used to can be replaced by would:
When I was young, I'd (I would) often go⋯.
This use of would is found in narrative (rather than conversational) style.
Used to cannot be replaced by would when it is used to indicate that a past habit has been discontinued:
This sort of novel used to be very popular (but it isn't now). I used to live near my work (but I don't now).
Pattern drill
1 I used to eat a lot of sweets. This impli:es‘but I don't
now’; so used to cannot be replaced by would.
2 Don't worry, he's used to driving. Be used to=be accustomed
to (SD 55a).
3 Theyusedtokeepadog.Notimeismentionedda‘nkeeping
a dog’ is not a‘routine action’; so used to cannot be replaced by would.
⋯and they were always taking it for walks! The past continuous used with always describes frequently repeated actions (in the past).

‘Many’, ‘A lot of’
a For as+adjective+as, see KS 32. Remember that a little/a few = not much/many, but enough; very little/very few = not much/many, and not enough (KS 32).
b In affirmative sentences much (of) is usually replaced by a lot (of), or less commonly by a great/good deal (of); many (of) is often replaced by a lot (of), or less commonly by a great/good many (of) or a great number (of).
e. g.
He doesn't have much mone.yHe has a lot (a great deal) of money. He doesn't read much. He reads a lot (a great deal).
We don't sell many of our products overseas.
We sell a lot (a great many/number) of our products overseas. c Note the comparative constructions with the same as and

drill 2). Some speakers still insist that formal, ‘correct’ English requires‘⋯ taller than I(am)’,‘than’ being an adverb, not a preposition, but the object pronoun is more usual‘,than’ being treated as a preposition+object when the verb is omitted.
2 My brother is much taller than yours. Compare a little taller (Pattern drill 1).
They're about the same height. i. e. My brother is about the same height as yours.
3 Is Scotch whisky very different from Irish whisky? Practice in using different from. The adjective Scotch is always used for whisky, but Scottish is the standard adjective for everything else.
A Scot could tell you better than I can. Note the tenses here. The use of could implies the conditional (Type 2) sente:ncIef you asked a Scot, he could tell you.
4 What a lot of jam/eggs Tom's taken! Note that much/many cannot be used after exclamatory What⋯!
He's taken much/many more than he did yesterday. Note the use and tense of did, replacing ‘took’(i. e. ⋯more than he took yesterday).

Key to Summary Writing

Since the villagers believe that if anyone pkisc a leaf he will die, they have asked the vicar to have the tree cut down. As the tree is a useful source of income, the vicar has refused to have the tree cut down. Meanwhile, though tourists have been picking leaves, not one of them has come to harm.

b
i With verbs like say, think, believe, know, find, etc. , in sentences like. People say (that) he is a genius, or People say (that) there is oil under the sea there are two possible passive forms:
It is said that he is a genius. It is said that there is oil under the sea.
He is said to be a genius. There is said to be oil under the sea.
The personal subject followed by an infinitive construction is preferable, especially in spoken English.
ii When an active verb has two objects (one direct, the other indirect), either object may be the subject of the passive verb. However, the indirect object, usually a person, is usually preferred unless there is a good reason for emphasizing the direct object, often a thing.
Compare:Have you got a pen?-Yes, I was given a blue pen for my birthday.
You got the blue pen, but what happened to the red pen?-The red pen was given to Mary because I didn't want it.

Key structures:The present tense, simple and continuous, used in place of Shall/Will
a
For going to + infinitive, to express intention in the future, see KS 36.
For shall/will in Type 1 conditions, see KS 16.
b
The present continuous is used to indicate a definite future
arrangement. The time is usually the immediate future and the time expression is generally included:
He's arriving tomorrow.
She's leaving in two days' time.
c
The simple present (NOT the simple future) is used after if
in Type 1 conditions and after temporal conjunctions (until, as soon as, after, before, when, etc. ) when referring to future :time
If it rains tomorrow, we shall stay at home.
I shall wait here until he comes.
The moment/As soon as he arrives, I shall let you know. Pattern drill
1 I'm visiting Mary this evening. The present continuous is
used to describe a future arrangement.
2 He's returning soon/ in two days' time. The present
continuous is again used for future arrangements.
3 I'll clean it before he comes. The simple present replaces
the future (will come) in the time clause.
4 She'll be tired when she arrives. The simple present is used
after when.
I'll look after her if she'stired. The simple present is used
after if in Type 1 conditional sentences.

Key to Summary writing
When the Hubble telescope was launched into space in April 1990, the pictures it sent us were very disappointing because the main mirror was faulty. Four astronauts will soon be making the necessary repairs, and eventually, pictures from the Hubble will tell us a great deal about the age and size of the universe.
(54 words)
Key to Composition
There was trouble with the Hubble right from the start. The main mirror was faulty, so the pictures it sent us were very

disappointing. Now the shuttle Endeavour will be taking four astronauts to make the necessary repairs, so that the Hubble will soon be sending us the clearest pictures of the stars and distant galaxies that we have ever seen.
Key structures:The simple present perfect used in place of the future perfect after temporal conjunctions
a For the future continuous and the future perfect simple, see KS 37.
b The future perfect continuous is formed with shall/will + have + been + present participle. Compare the following:
Soon the astronauts will have repaired the t elescope (the action will be completed).
By Friday midday, they will have been working on it for seven days (the action will still be in progress).
c The present perfect is used in place of the future perfect after temporal conjunctions (after, as soon as, before, etc. ) Compare:
He will have arrived by this time tomorrow.
The moment/As soon as he has arrived, I shall let you know. Note that the simple present and the present perfect may be
interchangeable after temporal conjunctions (see KS 60c):
We shall go out this afternoon. It will have stopped raining
by then.
As soon as it has stopped (OR As soon as it stops) raining,
we shall go out.
Note the use of the present perfect (NOT the simple present)
after now that:
(I've finished work. ) Now thatyou've finished work, you can
go home.
Pattern drill
1 By the time⋯, I'll have been making them for a year. The future perfect continuous describes an action which, at a given time in the future, will already have been in progress for some time (and will continue).
2 When I've made this one, I'll have made thirteen altogether. The future perfect is used for an action which, at a given time
in the future, will be completed. Note that the present perfect replaces the future perfect after when.
3 Let me know (i. e. Tell me) when he arrives. The present replaces the future in the time clause. We could also use the present perfect:Let me know when he's arrived.
4 You can post it as soon as you've written it. The present perfect replaces the future perfect after as soon as.

It took the firemen nearly three weeks to get the forest fire under control. Now that all the great trees had been burnt,hetre was danger that heavy rain would cause serious floods which would destroy the surrounding villages. To prevent this, the forest authorities ordered grass-seed which was sprayed over the ground by planes for nearly a month. By the time that it began torain, the grass had taken root in many places.

Key structures:The past perfect, simple and continuous
a
For the past perfect with before and in reported speech, see KS 38b.
b
i When already is used with a past action that occurred before another past action, the past perfect must be used. Compare:
He finished (OR had finished) work before I arrived.
He had already finished work before I arrived (only one form possible).
ii The past perfect continuous is used to emphasize continuity. Compare:
He (had) worked in a factory before he got this job.
He had been working in a factory for years before he got this job.
iii In indirect spe ech the present perfect becomes past perfect:
‘What have you lost’? I asked. I asked him what he had lost.
‘What have you been doing’? I asked. I asked him what he had been doing.
Pattern drill
1 He said he'd been working. The direct speech would be : ‘I've been working.’The past perfect replaces the present perfect in the indirect speech.
2 She'd been thinking about the exams. i. e. her ‘looking anxious’was the result of what she had been doing for some time before.
3 Yes, they'd already finished it when I arrived. The past perfect is used with already to describe an action completed before another past action. Compare this sentence with:
They finished it when I arrived, which means‘I arrived and then they finished it. ’
4 I'd been collecting stamps for years before I met my wife. The past perfect continuous with for + period of time emphasizes the continuity of the action.

Key structures:Indirect speech (indirect commands)
a
For the sequence of tenses in indirect statements and questions,
take a taxi
call the police
leave now
pay the bill

see KS 15, 39. b
The most usual way to turn a direct command into an indirect command is to replace the verb say (where this introduces the direct speech) and use a verb of command (tell, order, co mmand) or of request (ask) or a verb such as advise, warn, invite, etc. The verb is followed by an object + to-infinitive:
e. g. ‘Open the door for me please, ’ she said (to me). She asked me to open the door for her.
‘Open the door for me!’ she said (to me).
She told me to open the door for her.
Note the position of not in the negative:
She told the children not to make so much noise.
c
The verbs insist and suggest cannot be used with the object
+ infinitive construction. They are commonly followed by a that-clause + should:
He insisted that I should stay to lunch.
He suggested that I should go with him.
Pattern drill
1 He's telling you to be quiet. Reported command in the
present. Note the stress on you (S2).
N. B. In all these drills, the stimulus (T) initiates the
exchange and it will be more realistic if S 1 and S2 usethe pronouns He, She, him, her, etc. according to whether their teacher (or whoever gives the stimulus) is male or female.
2 She asked me to lend her abook. Reported request. I advise you not to lend her ANYthing! Indirect negative command (Don't lend her anything!). Note the position of not and the stress on anything.
3 Why don't they pay her? Why don't/doesn't ⋯? is a very common way of expressing a suggestion.
He suggested that they should pay her. Reported suggestion. That may be omitted.
4 He's still insisting that we should stay. Reported command. Note that should is used in the that-clause even when insist is in the present.
Oh dear! His wife 's just warned me NOT to stay! Reported negative command. Note the stress on not.
Repetition drill

Key to Summary writing
The tunnel, which the French engineer, AiémThomé, planned to build under the English Channel in 1858, would be ventilated by tall chimneys built above sea level. An Englishman, William Lowe, suggested a better plan two years later. Passing trains would solve the problem of ventilation in his proposed double railwaytunnel because they would draw in fresh air behind them. Though workanbeg forty-two years later, it was stopped because the British feared invasion. However, the tunnel was officially opened on March 7,

1994.
Key to Composition
(85 words)
1 Thanks to the English Channel, which separates Britain from Europe, the country has not been invaded since 1066.
2 However, now that modern warfare is far more complex, such fears no longer exist.
3 Both Britain and Europe would benefit enormously from a Channel Tunnel.
Key structures:Type 3 conditional statements
a
Type 1 (if + present + tense + shall/ will/ can/ may):the condition is likely to be fulfilled (KS 16).
Type 2 (if + past tense + should/would/ could/ might):the condition is unlikely to be fulfilled or is contrary to known facts (KS 40b).
b
Type 3 conditional statements are‘impossible’conditions,
i. e. they cannot be fulfilled, because the statements always refer to past events. In such statements, if is followed by the past perfect tense and the verb in the main clause is in the perfect conditional (should/ would/ could/ might + have + past partici:ple) e. g. You would have missed your train if you had not hurried (but you did hurry, so you caught your train).
If you had gone to the exhibition, you would have enjoyed it (but you didn't go).
Note that could have + past participle may replace had been able to + infinitive in an if-clause:
If you could have made (=If you had been able to make) him change his mind, you would have saved him a lot of trouble.
Pattern drill
1 Yes, I'm sure they'd have liked him very much if they had met him. Type 3 condition.
Note that there is a slight stress on had (if they HAD met him). We could also say:if they'd met him (without any stress).
2 She wouldn't have made a mistake if she'd listened to me. Type 3 condition (i. e. she didn't listen to me).
3 He had to work hard to pass the exam. Note that to (pass) =in order to (pass).

The Lancaster bomber was not too badly damaged when it crashed
on a remote island in the South Pacific. Then the wreck remained undisturbed for twenty-six years until it was rediscovered in an aerial survey of the island. The French authorities had the plane packaged and moved in parts back to France, where a group of enthusiasts will be having it restored. They will have to have three of the engines rebuilt, but the fourth engine is still in perfect condition because a colony of bees had turned it into a hive and
it was totally covered in beeswax.

(99 words)
1 When the Lancaster bomber crashed it was not too badly damaged, but the isla nd was so remote that the wreck remained undisturbed for more than twenty years.
    2  Now some enthusiasts in France who plan to have the plane

restored are absolutely delighted.
3 They will only need to have three of the engines rebuilt
because the fourth one was preserved in beeswax, and is still as sweet as honey.
Key structures:Have (causative use)
a
For have used to express possession and used as an ordinary verb, see KS 18, 42.
b
Instead of sentences of the type:‘I employed someone to do something for me’, we can use the construction:have + object + past participle:
I had my car washed. = I asked/ employed someone (at the garage) to wash my car for me.
Note that the speaker is not interested in the person who washed the car, but only in the fact that the car was washed.
When have is used in this way, the negative and interrogative of the present and past tenses are formed with do:
How often do you have your car washed?
I didn't have it washed last week-I washed it myself!
Note the use of causative have with can, must, will, etc. : He must/ should have his hair cut.
Are you going to/ Can you/ Will you have your watch repaired? He had to have the plane rebuilt.
They shouldn't have had this room painted yellow.
Pattern drill
1 She had it made in town. The causative use of have (had it
made) in S2 is contrasted with make it herself in S1.
2 I've just had it cut. Have is used causatively in the present
perfect with just.
3 I'll have some taken next week. Have is used causatively
referring to the future.
4 He can't clean it himself! Why doesn't he have it cleaned?
Why doesn't he⋯is used to make a suggestion (see Lesson 63, note on Pattern drill 3). The causative use of have (have it cleaned) is contrasted with clean it himself.
Repetition drill
Chorus, group or individual repetition
To elicit affirmative statements involving the use of
causative have. The past tense only will be practised. T:Listen. Do not speak.

Key to Summary writing
Tazieff, the Polish scientist, went to Lake Kivu in the Congo in 1948 to observe a new volcano which he called Kituro. After taking photographs, he had to leave almost at once because a river of liquid rock threatened to surround him. He escaped just in time but he returned two days later when the volcano had become quiet. This time he climbed into the mouth of Kituro in order to take photographs and measure temperatures.

Key structures : The gerund after certain verbs and expressions
a
Note the use of the -ing form in the examples:
He enjoys/ likes/ hates playing football. It's no sue crying
about it.
He denies taking it (Compare:He denies that he took it, SD
29). b
The gerund is a verbal noun, so a possessive adjective can be used in front of it.
However, this is rather formal; in spoken English the object pronoun is more usual:
Would you mind my (or me) opening the window? (i. e. May I open it?)
Fancy your (or you) forgetting a thing like that!
c
Verbs of perception are followed by the-ing form (= present
participle) or the infinitive without to. Compare:
I saw him coming (i. e. I caught sight of him as he was in the
process of coming).
I saw him come into the shop (i. e. I watched him complete the
whole action of coming into the shop). d
After go and come, verbs which indicate physical activity and the verb to shop are often put into the -ing form:
Let's go dancing/ swimming/ riding. I went shopping/ skiing/ skating.
Pattern drill
1 I was Looking forward to seeing the film. i. e. I was looking forward to it until this moment, or until I knew that I wouldn't
be able to go. The gerund is used after look forward to.
2 I can't see anything coming. The present participle is used after verbs of perception:see, hear, smell.
3 Would you mind/ I don't mind calling John. The gerund is used after mind. Note that the answer‘No’means:I don't mind, so I will call him.

4 Will you come riding with us? Come + gerund of verbs indicating physical activity.
There's no point in my coming riding. The gerund is used after There's no point in (= It's no use). Note tuhse of the possessive adjective (my), which may be replaced by the object pronoun (me) in colloquial English.

Doctors have just operated on the mummy of an Egyptian woman who died in 800 B. C. They wanted to find out whether she died of
a rare disease. After removing a section of the mummy, they sent
it to a laboratory. During the operation, they unexpectedly found
a small wax figure of a god. Though they were afraid the mummy would fall to pieces, it successfully survived the operation.

2 She's sung solo on several occasions now. The present perfect (again contrasted with the simple past) describes an action completed in the recent past. Note that several times now mean:s several times up till now.
3 He's been crying, hasn't he? The present perfect continuous is used for a past action, the results of which can still be seen, i. e. his eyes are still red.
He cried during the film:the simple past + adverbial phrase tells us when he cried.

Key structures:The past continuous and ‘Used to’:Review (KS 7, 31, 55)
Pattern drill
1 John was driving the car this morning-.He doesn't usually drive it, does he?
The past continuous (describing a past action which continued over a period of time) is contrasted with the simple present (for a habitual action).
2 Mary hardly talked at all today-.She was talking all night. The past continuous (emphasizing continuity) is contrasted with the simple past.
3 John has been eating very little recently.- So I noticed. He used to eat a lot.
The present perfect continuous describes an action which has been in progress over a period of time and still continues. It is contrasted with used to + infinitive, describing an action which was recurrent or a state that was habitual in the past but has now ceased.
Note the use of so (So I noticed = I noticed that).
4 He used to be a thief, didn't he? Note the use of didn't in the question tag.
He used to be, but he was working in a bank the last time (that) I saw him. Note the need to repeat be after used to (compare Lesson 31, Pattern drill 3).

Key structures:The comparison of adjective:sReview (KS 8, 32, 56)
Pattern drill
1 They'd be much sweeter (than those oranges) or It'd be⋯ (than this bag).
Note that this is a conditional sentence (type 2). The if-clause is implied by 'd, i. e. If you got some Spanish oranges, they'd be sweeter.
The adjectives all form the comparative by adding-er (note: good - better).
2 It wasn't any dirtier than usual:i. e.⋯ than it usually is. The adjectives are all formed from the given nouns by adding -y (note:noisy, muddy), the comparative form being -ier.
3 She's the most attractive person I've ever met. The adjectives are all of 3 or more syalbles and form the superlative with most.
She's not as attractive as you are! Note that so could replace as in the negative and that the verb are could be omitted.
4 He drove as quickly as he could. The comparative of adverbs is practised. Note that logn, fast, hard, far (farther or further) and well (better) do not add -ly when they are adverbs.
He couldn't have driven any more quickly (than he did). Note that this is a conditional (type 3) statement, in which the if-clause is implied by the tense ofhte verb in the first claus:e He couldn't have driven any more quickly if he'd tried/if he'd wanted to. Any is again used for emphasis.

The moment the speedboat struck the buoy, both men were thrown
into the water. As it moved off very quickly across the water, the men began to swim towards the shore. Turning in a cir cle, the speedboat came straight towards them. After it had just missed them, they swam until they were out of danger. When the boat returned
it had lost speed. Soon all the petrol was used up and it floated across the water.
(76 words) Because the speedboat had struck a buoy, both men were thrown
into the water. It moved off very quickly and, while the men were swimming towards the shore, it turned in a circle, came straight towards them and only just missed them. They had no sooner swum out of danger than the boat returned. This time, however, it had lost speed because nearly all the petrol had been used up and it

floated across the water.

The man said that he did because he had to be at work at ten o'clock, and that his employer would confirm thathe was there on time. The inspector then asked him if a later train would get him to work on time. The man supposed that it would, but said that he never caught a later train. The inspector asked at what time he had arrived at the station. The man said that he had arrived at the station at ten

Key to Summary writing
Six men who have been trapped in a mine for seventeen hours may lose their lives because rescue operations are proving difficult. Since explosives might cause the roof of the mine to collapse, rescue workers are drilling a hole through hard rock, but progress is slow. Two hours ago, a microphone was lowered into the mine and the men have been in touch with their relatives. They are running short of food and drink but they are in good spirits.

Key structures:Must, Have to, Need, Shoul:dReview (KS 17, 41, 65)
Pattern drill
1 She needn't have washed the dishes. Needn't have + past participle indicates absence ofnecessity in the past, i. e. she washed the dishes, although it wasn't necessary for her to do so (compare Pattern drill 2).
She had to wash them or her husband would have been furious with her. Had to expresses necessity in the past. Note that this could also be expressed by a Type 3 conditional senten:ceIf she hadn't washed them, her husband would have been furious with her.
2 They'd already been typed, so she didn't have to type them. Didn't have to expresses absence of necessity in the past, i. e.
it wasn't necessary for her to type the letters, so she didn't type them (compare Pattern drill 1).
3 You mustn't read so much or you'll strain your eyes. Mustn't = prohibition. Note that the use of or again makes it possible to express this as a conditional sentence (see Pattern drill 1):
If you read so much, you'll strain your eyes.
I've got to do a lot of reading. Have got to (=have to) is used to express an‘external’ obligation, i. e. one that is imposed
by an authority or circumstances outside the speaker's control.
4 He ought to have arrived by now. Or He should have arrived by now. Ought to/should + have + past participle indicates an unfulfilled action (i. e. he hasn't arrived yet).
He must have been delayed. Must + have + past participle expresses deduction with reference to a past action.

Divers working on North Sea oil rigs are often terrified by
giant fish that bump into them when they are working in deep water. These fish are not sharks or whales. On the contrary, they are favourite eating varieties that grow to unnatu ral sizes. Three factors have caused this to happen:the first is the warmth from oil-pipes; the second is the supply of plentiful food; the third is the absence of fishing round the rigs.

While circling the balloon, the pilot saw three men in the basket, one of whom was holding a pair of binoculars. When it flew over the station, one of the men took photographs. Then it landed near an airfield, but the police could not arrest anyone because the basket contained two Members of Parliament and the Commanding Officer of the station. Afterwards the Commanding Officer explained that one half of the station did not know what the other half was doing.

Pattern drill
1
I've never seen you play chess. The present perfect is used
with never. Note that the infinitive (without to) is used after see (compare Lesson 92, Pattern drill 3).
But I often play chess! I was playing only yesterday! The simple present is used f or a habitual action. The past continuous indicates that the action (I was playing) continued over a period of time and suggests that the first speaker had plenty of time to see it. The simple past could also be used, but it would merely state that the action took place, without emphasizing the length
of time it was in progress. 2
Have you been making this film for long-?No, we've only just started making it.
The present perfect continuous + for is contrasted with the simple present perfect + only just.Note that for long = for a long time.

Key to KS Exercises
A When she asked what had happened and how his clothes had
got into such a mess, the Ambassador answered drily that a fire extinguisher had been responsible. He then told her that university students had set the Embassy on fire that morning. His wife was most surprised and asked him where he had been at the time. The Ambassador answered that he had been in his office as usual. When

the fire broke out in the basement, he had gone down to investigate and a man called oHrst had aimed a fire extinguisher at him. Horst thought the Ambassador was on fire. The Ambassador said that he must definitely get the fellow posted. His wife suddenly noticed
a big hole in her husband's hat and asked him how he could explain it. The Ambassador said that someone had fired a shot through his office window. The shot was accurate, but fortunately he had not been wearing his hat at the time. If he had, he would not have been able to get home for lunch.

The Japanese annual Festival for the Dead is a cheerful occasion. As the dead are said to return home, food is laid out for them and lanterns are lit to guide them on their way. People dance and sing all night and the uneaten food is thrown into the sea or into a river the next morning. In some places, the lanterns are placed on the sea and people watch from the shore until the lanterns drift out of sight.

Special difficulties:Review (SD 74-91)
Pattern drill
1
I said it's burning low. Verbs indicating a beginning, a
development or change of condition are followed by an adjective describing this condition (SD 75).
2
Do you consider it wrong to cheat? - Of course I think it's wrong to cheat.
Certain verbs, like consider, think, believe, feel, etc. may be used in the pattern verb + it + adj. +-tionfinitive, or in the pattern:verb + that-clause, i. e. verb (that + ) + it + be + adjective + to-infinitive (SD 84).
3
He isn't/is old enough to run.⋯ Enough is practised in the pattern:be + adjective + enough + to-infinitive.
4
That train's too early for me. I can't catch it. Note that these two sentences can be joined:
That train's too early for me to catch.
Neither can/shall/do/have I. When neither comes at the beginning of a clause, the subject and auxiliary verb are always inverted, as in these short responses. (SD 92).
Note that this drill may be done in a different way by using the opposites of the adjectives and so instead of neither, e. g.
T:easy exam, shall pass
S1:That exam's very easy. I shall pass it.
S2:So shall I.
T:cheap stamp, can afford
S1:That stamp's very cheap. I can afford it.
S2:So can I.
